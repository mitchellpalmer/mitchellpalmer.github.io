Hi. My name is [Mitchell Palmer](https://www.mitchellpalmer.nz). I am a first year 
undergraduate at [Yale-NUS College](http://yale-nus.edu.sg/), reading for a Bachelor of 
Arts with Honours. I intend to major in Economics with a minor in Mathematical, 
Computational, and Statistical Sciences.

Before matriculating at Yale-NUS, I worked for the Parliamentary Service in New
Zealand. While there, I worked at the intersection of politics and technology. Now,
I work occasionally as a political technology consultant for New Zealand causes and 
do freelance software development work for organisations, both politcal and not.
Here is my [CV/resume](https://www.mitchellpalmer.nz).

This blog contains my various rants, ramblings, and reckons. I am passionate about
economics, finance, politics, and technology, so I expect those topics to encompass
the vast majority of content here.

My hobbies include debating, programming, and rugby refereeing. I am a proficient 
programmer in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript (and TypeScript), and HTML/CSS, but I have some
experience with C++, OCaml, and a variety of other languages. As a debater, I have had
a modicum of success, including representing New Zealand while I was at secondary 
school, winning a variety of novice university titles, and coaching a regional
representative team.
