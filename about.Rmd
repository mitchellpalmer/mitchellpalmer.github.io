Hi. My name is [Mitchell Palmer](https://www.mitchellpalmer.nz). After studying in 
Singapore at Yale-NUS College for 18 months, I have returned home to New Zealand for 
a few months to work as a a policy analyst at the New Zealand Parliament. After that,
I will be matriculating at New College, a constituent college of the University of 
Oxford, to read history and economics. Here is my [CV/resume](https://www.mitchellpalmer.nz).

This blog contains my various rants, ramblings, and reckons. I am passionate about
economics, finance, politics, and technology, so I expect those topics to encompass
the vast majority of content here. The contents of this blog are entirely my own
opinions and do not necessarily represent the views of either my employer or any of
the academic institutions to which I am or have been affiliated.

My hobbies include debating, programming, and rugby refereeing. I am a proficient 
programmer in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript (and TypeScript), and HTML/CSS, but I have some
experience with C++, OCaml, and a variety of other languages. As a debater, I have had
a modicum of success, including representing New Zealand while I was at secondary 
school, winning a variety of novice university titles, and coaching a regional
representative team.
