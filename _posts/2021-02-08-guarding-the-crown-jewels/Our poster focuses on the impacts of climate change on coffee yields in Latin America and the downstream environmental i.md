Our poster focuses on the impacts of climate change on coffee yields in Latin America and the downstream environmental impacts thereof. Latin America is the world's most important coffee growing region and coffee is a crucial source of income for many of the region's poorest residents. Latin America is also home to some of the world's most important ecosystems â€” e.g., the Amazon River and Forrest. Thus, what happens to coffee yields there due to climate change matters for us all. We argue that climate change poses a significant threat to coffee yields in the region and that, beyond the obviously important human impacts, this may create negative downstream ecological consequences as farmers and ecosystems adapt to this change in productivity.

My particular contribution focused on the impact of rainfall changes on coffee yields. This issue engaged many of the skills I learnt in DI1, particularly because the rainfall impacts of climate change have not been (nor are they anticipated to be in future) consistent across the Americas and are subject to wide error bands. This makes careful consideration of uncertainties crucial in interpreting the data.
