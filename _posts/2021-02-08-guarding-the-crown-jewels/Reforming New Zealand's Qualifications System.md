Reforming New Zealand's Qualifications System.

Bunch of problems:

- Selective university courses can't discriminate between top candidates, requiring first-year weed-out processes, wasting everyone's time.
- Lack of comparability: One student's NCEA Level 3 is an academic rigorous qualification based on external examinations, another is essentially a vocational qualification graded on a pass-fail basis. Similarly, one cannot know what a person with NCEA Physics has learnt â€” depends on his teacher and school.
- Teacher workload is high, with teachers required to design curricula and assessment.

Structural issues are rife:

- New Zealand\'s qualification provider is also our qualification regulator, so there is no independent arbiter of standards.
- Only schools in wealthy areas can afford to offer competing examinations (e.g., Cambridge or IB), meaning NCEA essentially has a monopoly

Solution:

- Separate qualification provider component of NZQA from qualification regulator.
