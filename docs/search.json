After studying in Singapore at Yale-NUS College for 18\nmonths, I have returned home to New Zealand for a few months to work as\na a policy analyst at the New Zealand Parliament. After that, I will be\nmatriculating at New College, a constituent college of the University of\nOxford, to read history and economics. Here is my CV/resume.\nThis blog contains my various rants, ramblings, and reckons. I am\npassionate about economics, finance, politics, and technology, so I\nexpect those topics to encompass the vast majority of content here. The\ncontents of this blog are entirely my own opinions and do not\nnecessarily represent the views of either my employer or any of the\nacademic institutions to which I am or have been affiliated.\nMy hobbies include debating, programming, and rugby refereeing. I am\na proficient programmer in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript (and TypeScript),\nand HTML/CSS, but I have some experience with C++, OCaml, and a variety\nof other languages. As a debater, I have had a modicum of success,\nincluding representing New Zealand while I was at secondary school,\nwinning a variety of novice university titles, and coaching a regional\nrepresentative team.\nIf you want to find out more about me or contact me, you can follow\nme on Twitter at @M_W_Palmer, connect with me on\nLinkedIn,\nvisit my main website, see\nmy Github profile at mitchellpalmer, or email me\nat mp (at) mitchellpalmer.nz\n\n\n\n",
