    "contents": "\nI am currently working on reimplementing, with New Zealand data, David Miles and Victoria Monro’s interesting working paper (Miles and Monro 2019) in which they deconstruct the drivers of UK house prices to understand what effect lower interest rates are having on housing costs. (The Bank of England blog has a great non-technical explanation of Miles and Munro’s work.) As part of that work, I have to find estimates for rental yields in New Zealand over time and compare them to the prevailing risk-free interest rate. That has yielded some counter-intuitive results.\nRental yields are the gross (annual) rent payments received from a property as a proportion of its market value. Put mathematically: \\(Yield = \\frac{Rent \\times 52}{Market Price}\\). Thus, if prices increase while rents are held constant (or increase more slowly), the yield will fall. Similarly, if rents increase while house prices stay the same, the yield will increase. On a national basis, they can be estimated by dividing the average rent by the average house price. This number is particularly important in our current conversation about the role of the Reserve Bank in driving house price inflation. RBNZ targets the Consumer Price Index, which includes rents, but does not include house prices. Thus, if house prices are increasing rapidly but rents aren’t rising quite so quickly, RBNZ won’t care so much1. We can see if house prices and rents are becoming decoupled by looking at rental yields.\nRental yields are simply an interest rate. Just as the interest rate on a term deposit represents the (gross) cash return from holding money in a certain type of investment, so too does a rental yield. As an interest rate, rental yields should increase in tandem with the risk of the investment. This is for the simple reason that, as a saver, if you were offered two investment opportunities with the same return but different risk profiles, you would choose the less risky option. As such, in order for the investment market to clear, riskier assets must offer sufficiently higher returns. For that same reason, interest rates should not fall below the ‘risk-free rate’, which can be earnt by lending to the Government.\nNew Zealand Government debt is assumed to be essentially riskless. This is, firstly, because, if it is issued in the NZ Dollar (which most NZ Government debt is), the Government can simply inflate the currency to pay off the debts if it is in danger of default, and, secondly, because the Government has a triple- or double-A credit rating even for its foreign currency debt, meaning it is very unlikely to default in any case.\nThe result of that is that the interest rate of any given asset can be understood as a function of two numbers: One, the risk-free rate offered by Government debt, and two, the riskiness of the asset. That is, \\(r = R_f + RP\\) – the interest rate for any asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus a premium paid as compensation for accepting a riskier asset (the risk premium).\nDespite the hackneyed saying referenced in the title2, residential property is not risk-free. Rents could, for instance, fall precipitously if a glut of supply entered the market or if demand growth slowed significantly (cf. post-earthquake Christchurch, where both happened) or, perhaps, if the Government were to make a drastic regulatory change (like Singapore’s did in 1967 when it engaged in large-scale land nationalisation) or if the world economy/bank funding crashes into a brick wall (remember 2008).\nIn addition, holding rental property is significantly more expensive than holding government debt. Remember that the yield in question here is the gross yield, before taxes or any other expenses. Maintenance must be done, rates must be paid, and a property manager must be employed (or his labour must be done by the landlord herself). In order to incur those costs, one would expect investors to demand either more cashflow or a lower purchase price for the asset (both of which would increase the gross yield). By contrast, when one holds government debt (I presume – I have never actually bought any directly), the coupon payments are deposited in your bank account more or less automatically. In a tax sense, they are essentially equivalent except for the loss ring-fencing exemption which existed for property investors until recently. (This will be discussed later.)\nBoth of these factors lead me to expect that, when I plotted rental yields on a time-series graph, they would be significantly higher than the Government bond rate. After all, if investors could get a higher yield out of lending to the Crown, why would you take the extra risk and cost of investing in property?\n\n\n\nAs the above graph shows, however, that is far from always true. Indeed, over the period from 1993 to 2015 (when the RBNZ data I am relying on stops), only 14.4% of the time did rental yields exceed the risk-free rate as we would expect. Perhaps, however, it is due to the risk-free rate I have chosen: Maybe a 2- or 5-year time horizon is more appropriate3. However, as the graphs below show, that’s not true.\n\n\n\nThe above three graphs were based on rental yield estimates from the Reserve Bank’s May 2015 Financial Stability Report. They do not appear to have released similar data since then. I am not sure how these estimates were arrived at. Perhaps different estimates would behave more predictably.\nThat question did occur to me, so I rolled my own estimate of the prevailing rental yield, based on MBIE tenancy bond data and the house price index published by the Reserve Bank (which is converted to an indicative house price). As you can see below, it tracks quite closely to the RBNZ estimate but is uniformly a few basis points higher – given I don’t know how the RBNZ estimates were calculated, I cannot tell you why that is, but my guess would be that my indicative house price is a shade lower than theirs.\n\n\n\nGiven that my estimate for average rental yield is a shade higher than RBNZ’s (0.43 pp on average), it should be unsurprising that it conforms to the condition \\(y_{Rental} > R_{f}\\) more often – in this case, 52.3% of the time, the rental yield exceeds the 10-year bond yield in my estimate, vs. 19.3% in the RBNZ estimate of rental yields.\n\n\n\nThus, even once one changes (upwards) the estimate of rental yields, the weird fact still exists: Rental yields have, for long periods over the past 27 years, been substantially lower than the risk-free rate which could be earnt by lending to the Government. Miles and Munro’s paper includes a figure which shows rental yields substantially above the risk-free rate in the United Kingdom, so this isn’t a universal phenomenon:\nFigure from Miles and Munro (2019)Unlike Miles and Munro above, I have so far compared rental yields to a nominal measure of the risk-free rate. Perhaps that is incorrect because the capital gains embedded in housing act as an inflation hedge, meaning the correct comparable security would be inflation-protected Government securities. Unfortunately, I can’t find much long-term data on the yields of inflation-protected NZ Government bonds. I would also suggest that perhaps this is not an entirely apt comparison: Housing is at best a risky inflation hedge – it might tend to increase at least as fast as CPI generally, but it is not guaranteed to do so, unlike a directly indexed security.\nHowever, even taking the relevant inflation rate off the risk-free rate to produce an estimate of the inflation-protected rate, there are still periods (although they are much less frequent – and tend to be in the middle of property crashes) when the estimated rental yield is lower than the risk-free yield. More importantly, the average gap is far lower than the 6-percentage-point gap that Miles and Munro find in the UK (you can see the average as the blue dotted line on the spread graph – it’s just over 2%):\n\n\n\nFinally, if we use the RBNZ estimates of rental yields and compare them to the risk-free rate, we find more instances of the rental yields being below the risk-free rate and a generally lower spread – because, as mentioned above, the RBNZ yield tended to be slightly lower than mine. (N.b., RBNZ’s estimates of the rental yield run out in 2015 – values beyond that date are generated by taking my estimate and subtracting an adjustment for the average amount that the RBNZ estimate was below mine. Values so generated are indicated by dotted lines)\n\n\n\nRecently, this odd situation appears to have rectified itself, for now: Rental yields are a much more explainable 500 or so basis points above the real risk-free rate. The question is: Why did it persist for so long? And why in New Zealand but not in the United Kingdom (which has also had a very buoyant property market in recent times)?\nBut just before someone yells at me about it all being a supply issue: You’re preaching to the converted. I have written policy documents calling the inability to free up housing supply the largest government failure this century. Housing supply affects house prices through the channel of rents – as more housing becomes available rents (and imputed rents) fall, which drives down house prices. That will have an indeterminate effect on rental yields (depending on whether rents fall instantly or are simply expected to fall over time), but in rough terms, supply failures increase both the denominator (house prices) and the numerator (rents) of the rental yield equation, so don’t really change it. Low rental yields are an interesting artefact of their own, though – because they affect people’s ability to access property ownership, as opposed to housing. Low yields are actually quite good news for renters, but they’re dreadful news for first home-buyer because they mean you have to collect a big deposit in order to buy a house, the purchase of which won’t reduce your rental bill by much, because as a percentage of house prices it was low.\nPerhaps investors expected capital gains. The mere expectation that prices will rise in the future will increase prices today, without any change in the current income-earning potential of the asset (i.e., the rental revenue), as investors attempt to capture those capital gains for themselves. This drives up prices without driving up rents too (because it is about future expectations, not the present situation), lowering the yield substantially.\nWhere do those expectations of capital gains come from though? The canonical model of asset prices says that the price of any cash-returning asset will be equal to the sum of its future cashflows, discounted to the present by an appropriate rate. This discounting occurs because money tomorrow is worth less than money today – asset prices thus increase as the expected value of future cashflows increases and decrease as prevailing interest rates increase. The relationship between interest rates and asset prices can also be understood more parochially in terms of lower interest rates increasing borrowing ability and thus demand for investment products.\nLet’s deal with interest rates first: If investors expect interest rates to fall over time, that would lead them to discount future earnings less (because the opportunity cost of waiting for the cash falls, as the interest which could be earnt falls), increasing their valuation of the asset. The figures below show the actual (5-year risk-free) interest rate and investors’ expectations of the (5-year risk-free) interest rate 5 years hence4.\n\n\n\nNo clear pattern is discernable, except that investors tend to expect rates to increase when they’re high and decrease when they’re low. I don’t think this data is sufficient to conclude that it is expectations about interest rates driving these low yields, but just to check, I have plotted the expected change in interest rates against rental yields and, just as expected, there is no obvious relationship:\n\n\n\nIn terms of expected future cashflow: Perhaps there is an expectation on the part of investors that rents will increase substantially in future as a result of supply limitations and demand growth and perhaps this expectation has remained for the past 30 years. This would drive them to purchase property and drive up prices. One would expect, however, such expectations to eventually come true – and yields to increase once these increases have been fully priced in and these rents start being earnt. That does not appear to have happened yet: Rents have certainly increased, but prices have increased even further.\nPerhaps the fact that prices are outstripping rents (and interest rates) suggests it isn’t (or, perhaps, wasn’t) fundamentals driving the housing market, but a greater fool theory of pricing. Investors assume that these assets will be worth more in the future, not because of higher cashflows or lower interest rates (both of which are eminently sensible reasons for prices to increase) but simply because of a mania for housing assets. That suggests the existence of a housing bubble. (This isn’t investment advice, just a possible interpretation of the data.) However, given rental yields have adopted a more normal posture recently, I would suggest this bubble may have slowed down if it did exist in the first place.\nPerhaps, also the previous unusual tax treatment of residential property has artificially held down yields. The non-ring-fencing of property losses, which allowed losses in residential property investment to be claimed against non-property income to reduce taxable income, might have encouraged investors to bid somewhat more than was immediately economic for properties, in the knowledge that these short-term losses would be offset somewhat by reducing their tax bill. Perhaps the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing also plays some part in this. The returns of housing (i.e., imputed rents) aren’t taxed (when the house is owned by the occupier), whereas the returns of alternative forms of investment (e.g., KiwiSaver) are. This doesn’t affect property investors directly, but owner-occupiers also receive a yield-in-kind (in the form of rents they don’t have to pay). If those returns are not taxed, they might be willing to accept a lower gross yield and thus bid higher – this will have a downstream impact on the yields earnt by investors as asset prices increase.\nPerhaps, however, investors have seriously, at times, believed that debt issued by the New Zealand government was a more risky investment than residential property. If they have so believed, I have some bridges to sell them. More likely, those weird anomalies are a result of property transactions having large transaction costs and rents being somewhat sticky.\nThe New Zealand rental yield does appear unusually stable. Compare the fluctuations in the UK rental yield to those in New Zealand – the UK yield appears to have ranged from roughly 13% in the mid-1990s to around 5% just before the GFC, whereas New Zealand’s yield (rather, my estimate thereof) has ranged from a maximum of 7.61% in 1993 to a minimum of 3.92% in 2016. By contrast, both countries’ headline interest rates have varied by large (and broadly similar) amounts. I am not sure why the market is sticky (especially given New Zealand has no obvious regulatory stickiness imposed, e.g., rent controls or strict tenancy protections), but it appears to be.\nI don’t have a favourite theory, but I think this is an interesting datapoint. I would be interested to hear people’s thoughts on it.\n\n\n\nMiles, David, and Victoria Monro. 2019. “UK house prices and three decades of decline in the risk‑free real interest rate.” Bank of England working papers 837. Bank of England. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/uk-house-prices-and-three-decades-of-decline-in-the-risk-free-real-interest-rate.\n\n\nAt least, they won’t target it directly as part of their inflation-targeting mandate. Their financial stability mandate does lead the RBNZ to care about house prices, however, explaining why they have adopted macro-prudential tools like LVR restrictions on mortgage lending in the past.↩\nAccording to the OED, “as safe as houses” dates back at least to 1850.↩\nUnfortunately, the 1-year wholesale bond data from RBBNZ has many gaps in it.↩\nThese expectations are derived using the standard equation for converting spot rates at different durations into forward rates↩\n",

[NEW]\nHow were the special votes distributed? [NEW]\n\nI wrote a post on Election Night laying out how the various parties performed across the 72 electorates in New Zealand. Since then, approximately half a million more special votes have been counted. A number of people, both on Twitter and in private correspondence, have asked me to update my analysis with those new numbers. That’s what this post does.\nThe specials did not really shift the broad picture – destruction for National and elation for Labour – but simply emphasised it (with the possible exeception of the Māori Party getting two MPs).This post is therefore essentially a copy-paste of my previous analysis with annotations explaining how the inclusion of the special votes has changed the story: Struck-through text is text which appeared in the original version, but is no longer true when special votes are counted. Bold text is new with special votes. The graphs and tables and in-text numbers are entirely populated with new data. You can see the pre-specials figures here. Some new analysis, including of the effect and spread of special votes, is included at the end.\nWow. What a result. The broad national narrative of Election 2020 for each party seems clear:\nLabour got a stonking victory, delivering a massive personal mandate for Jacinda Ardern\nNational had a dismal night, which managed to be worse than expected\nACT had a great night, confirming months of positive polling\nThe Greens outperformed, though perhaps Labour’s result was marginally too good for their tastes.\nThe Māori Party might be are back from the dead\nNew Zealand First should be dead for good – although making that prediction is perhaps never wise\nHowever there is also much to be said about the individual constituencies at play. That is what I’m going to do in this post. I’m not making an argument in this post, just exploring the data to see what happens.\nA couple of notes first:\nThese data were scraped from the Electoral Commissions website at around 1am NZT, when just under 100% of advance and ordinary votes had been counted. They may have changed marginally since then.\nSpecial votes won’t be counted for some time, which, given how tight some of the constituency results were, might effect this analysis.\nThis analysis was conducted late at night – taking advantage of my time difference from being based in Singapore – and quickly so it might not be right. I have released my source code on Github, please let me know if something looks off.\nPlease feel free to email me at mp (at) mitchellpalmer.nz if you have any questions.\nI no longer have the excuse of lateness or urgency if anything is broken, but please still let me know if you spot anything amiss.\nIn addition, I should disclose that I worked for ACT during this election, not that there is much opportunity for any of this analysis to take a partisan slant.\nWhy is this interesting?\nFinding out where the votes for each party were found tells us a lot about their electoral strategy and the coalitions they have built. It also lets us find out who the most popular MPs are, aside from their party affiliation.\nThis election, however, it is particularly interesting for two reasons.\nFirstly, because of the utter implosion of the National party vote but the smaller fall in their electorate votes, a significant proportion of National’s seats will be filled by electorate MPs. Thus, while your electorate vote may not decide the government, it will shape the balance of power within the opposition.\nSecondly, three minor parties may have managed to sieze or hold electorates: ACT retained its traditional stronghold of Epsom with an increased majority; the Māori Party have most likely siezed Waiariki; and, after a much-reported-on three-way race, the Greens look to have taken Auckland Central. Given the coat-tailing rules in MMP, a growing trend of minor parties winning electorates could substantially change the make-up of Parliament. This year, we have seen the coat-tailing rule in action for the first time in a little while, with Debbie Ngarewa-Packer coming in on the list for the Māori Party, despite the party recieving less than 5% of the party vote..\nHow did the parties do?\n\n\n\nClearly, National significantly outperformed in candidate votes compared to their party vote performance. That is mirrored in the constituency counts: National had the plurality (i.e., the most votes) of candidate votes in 26 23 electorates, but the plurality of party votes in only four one1. Why? Three possibilities occur to me (ranked in order of estimated importance):\nElectorate votes are sticky: Perhaps voters are less willing to abandon their local MP, to whom they can attach a face and a name, than parties, which after all are simply brands. Given National won the most electorates in 2017, that this stickiness favoured National is unsurprising.\nNational’s local campaigns were better than their national campaign: Perhaps the collegial nature of constituency committees and the independent mandates of MPs with their supporters meant that local campaigns worked together better than the chaotic national National Party.\nNational’s candidates were better than Labour’s candidates: In my view, this is definitely true in many parts of the country (e.g., Hutt South), but I struggle to think of any non-partisan reason this would be true generally. If it is true though, it certainly would help explain this phenomenon.\n\nI think reason 3 is especially doubtful given the well-documented problems seen in National’s candidate selection process recently.\n\n\n\nAs an aside, readers may be surprised to see such strong candidate vote performances from ACT and Greens, both of which have been known to run party vote-focused campaigns. This can mostly be explained by strong performances in their targetted ‘backstop’ seats (Epsom and Auckland Central), which they presumably seek/sought as an insurance policy to keep them in Parliament if they recieved less than 5% of the party vote. Indeed, 19.96% of ACT’s total electorate votes were in Epsom and 7.79% of the Greens’ total electorate votes were in Auckland Central. By contrast, if Green candidate votes were equally distributed across the country, given they ran in 60 seats, one would expect them to have recieved 1.67% of their candidate votes in each seat.\nAs mentioned above, the National Party achieved a plurality in only four one of the 72 electorates this election. Which were those seats?\n\nelectorate\nparty\nparty_vote_share\nEpsom\nNational Party\n37.28\n\n\n\n\nNotably absent from that list are National strongholds like Pakuranga (where Simeon Brown won by 10050), Selwyn (where Nicola Grigg won by a distance of 4968) and Judith Collins’ own seat of Papakura (which she took by 5583 votes). Those are a lot of traditionally National seats where another party (i.e., Labour) won the most votes. Those are seats National may well have lost in a first-past-the-post system.\nBut, perhaps National suffered from the success of its resurgent partners, ACT? Those are still votes for the right, so they shouldn’t count as real loses, the logic might go. While that certainly does help, it doesn’t make a real difference: In a good-old-fashioned two-party FPP election, National would still have lost resoundingly. When one sums the left bloc (Greens and Labour) and the right bloc (ACT and National), the right still only takes 12 9 seats out of 72 avaliable, none of which they would hold by more than 3000 2,200 votes. Even Selwyn, long National’s safest seat or close to it, would have been marginal: The right led there by less than 700 votes. Even Epsom, long one of the bluest (in party vote terms) seats in the country, would have been held by only 349 votes.\n\nelectorate\nright_bloc\nleft_bloc\nright_majority\nTaranaki-King Country\n19499\n17303\n2196\nWaikato\n19902\n17742\n2160\nSouthland\n19260\n17426\n1834\nPort Waikato\n19099\n17726\n1373\nWhangaparāoa\n21523\n20444\n1079\nTāmaki\n20322\n19282\n1040\nEpsom\n20023\n19674\n349\nEast Coast Bays\n18023\n17725\n298\nPakuranga\n17585\n17429\n156\n\nHow did the candidates do?\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a strong relationship between how a party performed and how its candidates performed. Plugging the party vote and candidate vote into a simple linear regression2 shows that, for a major party candidate in a general electorate, 64.74% of the variation in their candidate vote can be predicted from the party vote. Once the model accounts for the overall differences between National and Labour this year, the proportion accounted for shoots up to 85.21%.\n\n\n\nThe obvious question then is “What about that 14.79%”? Which candidates did well? By regressing the candidate vote against both the party from which the candidate comes and that party’s party vote, we can come up with the predicted result of an ‘average’ National/Labour candidate standing in that seat and work out which candidates beat that ‘benchmark’. Here are the list from Labour:\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"electorate\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"winner\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"lgl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"predicted_cv\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate_vote\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"outperformance\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Mt

shouldn’t immediately conclude from this that every Labour MP should have campaigned like Duncan Webb and every National MP should have campaigned like Chris Bishop. An MP who did a bad job spreading the party vote message in their constituency, but did a passable one promoting themselves, would do very well on this metric. But we can conclude that a constituency candidate’s fate is not entirely in the hands of their party – they can change it in or against their own favour. (A better model would also account for incumbency bias – outperformers tend to be incumbents, probably because of their preexisting local profile – and perhaps also the depth of the field – so as to avoid unduly punishing candidates like Helen White who run in the three-horse races.)\n\nDuncan Webb was chosen because he has the largest overperformance of the backbench Labour MPs who actually won their seats.\nWhere did they do well?\nThis will be a longer post sometime in the future. In that post, I’ll see what predicts support for each of the parties based on the characteristics of the constituencies. But, in the mean time, here are the party votes cast in the general electorates aggregated into some rough regions (please excuse my poor New Zealand geography, especially residents of the Central North Island – I have no reason to be bad at it. I just am.):\nThe aforementioned post is avaliable here: https://mitchellpalmer.shinyapps.io/Election2020Interactive/\n\nN.b., this interactive tool has not yet been updated to include special votes.\n\n\n\nHow concentrated was each parties’ support? [NEW]\nMy intuiton was that some parties (e.g., the Greens) tend to amass their party votes in a small number of electorates, by running up large totals, whereas others have broader geoegraphical support. The easiest way to see this is to calculate the number of electorate party vote totals one must add together to get to 50% (or any arbitrary proportion) of that party’s nationwide vote. These are the results of doing just that, bearing out my initial hypothesis – the Greens got more than half of their votes in only 20 electorates, whereas Labour took 32 electorates to recieve 50% of their overall votes. Naturally, the Māori Party also had very concentrated support – in the Māori seats.\n\nparty\nn_elecs\nACT New Zealand\n25\nGreen Party\n20\nLabour Party\n32\nMāori Party\n5\nNational Party\n26\nNew Zealand First Party\n28\n\nHow were the special votes distributed? [NEW]\n\n\n\nSpecial votes are not evenly distributed. Some electorates see many more voters casting special votes (which you must cast if you are registering on the day of the election, are overseas [like I was], or cast your vote in a different electorate to the one in which you are registered). Most commentators (and I) believe that special voters skew younger than the population as a whole – I am unaware of any empirical evidence for this supposition though, although perhaps it could be found in the excellent New Zealand Election Survey. Generally, specials are expected to favour the left.\nThese are the electorates sorted by the percentage of their party votes cast via a special vote:\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"electorate\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"specials_pct\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"total_special_party_votes\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Māngere\",\"2\":\"33.10817\",\"3\":\"10342\"},{\"1\":\"Manurewa\",\"2\":\"31.26957\",\"3\":\"9288\"},{\"1\":\"Hauraki-Waikato\",\"2\":\"29.52373\",\"3\":\"7042\"},{\"1\":\"Tāmaki Makaurau\",\"2\":\"28.99069\",\"3\":\"7626\"},{\"1\":\"Panmure-Ōtāhuhu\",\"2\":\"27.65702\",\"3\":\"8538\"},{\"1\":\"Auckland Central\",\"2\":\"27.14731\",\"3\":\"9839\"},{\"1\":\"Takanini\",\"2\":\"26.32801\",\"3\":\"9526\"},{\"1\":\"Te Tai Tonga\",\"2\":\"26.26778\",\"3\":\"7573\"},{\"1\":\"Te Tai Hauāuru\",\"2\":\"25.91164\",\"3\":\"6516\"},{\"1\":\"Te Tai Tokerau\",\"2\":\"25.78154\",\"3\":\"7043\"},{\"1\":\"Waiariki\",\"2\":\"24.37380\",\"3\":\"6471\"},{\"1\":\"Ikaroa-Rāwhiti\",\"2\":\"23.92831\",\"3\":\"5928\"},{\"1\":\"Mt Roskill\",\"2\":\"23.07449\",\"3\":\"8760\"},{\"1\":\"Epsom\",\"2\":\"22.32192\",\"3\":\"9304\"},{\"1\":\"Maungakiekie\",\"2\":\"21.85662\",\"3\":\"8137\"},{\"1\":\"Kaipara ki Mahurangi\",\"2\":\"21.54515\",\"3\":\"9861\"},{\"1\":\"Kelston\",\"2\":\"21.46078\",\"3\":\"7519\"},{\"1\":\"Papakura\",\"2\":\"21.03198\",\"3\":\"8360\"},{\"1\":\"Mt Albert\",\"2\":\"20.76788\",\"3\":\"8606\"},{\"1\":\"Wellington Central\",\"2\":\"20.71908\",\"3\":\"9906\"},{\"1\":\"Upper Harbour\",\"2\":\"19.40284\",\"3\":\"7785\"},{\"1\":\"Christchurch Central\",\"2\":\"18.73410\",\"3\":\"7512\"},{\"1\":\"Te Atatū\",\"2\":\"18.72752\",\"3\":\"7132\"},{\"1\":\"Bay of Plenty\",\"2\":\"18.72394\",\"3\":\"8352\"},{\"1\":\"New Lynn\",\"2\":\"18.33859\",\"3\":\"7614\"},{\"1\":\"Hamilton East\",\"2\":\"17.90517\",\"3\":\"7043\"},{\"1\":\"Tāmaki\",\"2\":\"17.88065\",\"3\":\"7416\"},{\"1\":\"Hamilton West\",\"2\":\"17.83837\",\"3\":\"7092\"},{\"1\":\"Botany\",\"2\":\"17.35744\",\"3\":\"6529\"},{\"1\":\"Rongotai\",\"2\":\"17.28134\",\"3\":\"7844\"},{\"1\":\"Wigram\",\"2\":\"17.25549\",\"3\":\"6662\"},{\"1\":\"Ilam\",\"2\":\"17.04217\",\"3\":\"7360\"},{\"1\":\"Christchurch East\",\"2\":\"17.00864\",\"3\":\"6872\"},{\"1\":\"North Shore\",\"2\":\"16.69557\",\"3\":\"7027\"},{\"1\":\"Taranaki-King Country\",\"2\":\"16.57327\",\"3\":\"6743\"},{\"1\":\"Northcote\",\"2\":\"16.55603\",\"3\":\"6634\"},{\"1\":\"Whangaparāoa\",\"2\":\"16.34536\",\"3\":\"7351\"},{\"1\":\"Mana\",\"2\":\"16.31905\",\"3\":\"6987\"},{\"1\":\"East Coast Bays\",\"2\":\"16.31104\",\"3\":\"6230\"},{\"1\":\"Pakuranga\",\"2\":\"16.12696\",\"3\":\"6021\"},{\"1\":\"Ōtaki\",\"2\":\"16.07412\",\"3\":\"7347\"},{\"1\":\"Waikato\",\"2\":\"15.98875\",\"3\":\"6596\"},{\"1\":\"Port Waikato\",\"2\":\"15.95819\",\"3\":\"6412\"},{\"1\":\"Hutt South\",\"2\":\"15.62362\",\"3\":\"7080\"},{\"1\":\"Tauranga\",\"2\":\"15.21699\",\"3\":\"6585\"},{\"1\":\"Remutaka\",\"2\":\"15.19037\",\"3\":\"6539\"},{\"1\":\"Ōhāriu\",\"2\":\"15.09061\",\"3\":\"6562\"},{\"1\":\"Rotorua\",\"2\":\"15.05967\",\"3\":\"5679\"},{\"1\":\"Taupō\",\"2\":\"14.80472\",\"3\":\"6463\"},{\"1\":\"Dunedin\",\"2\":\"14.74440\",\"3\":\"6755\"},{\"1\":\"Palmerston North\",\"2\":\"14.73881\",\"3\":\"5674\"},{\"1\":\"Banks Peninsula\",\"2\":\"14.52948\",\"3\":\"7161\"},{\"1\":\"East Coast\",\"2\":\"14.11531\",\"3\":\"5893\"},{\"1\":\"Selwyn\",\"2\":\"14.04800\",\"3\":\"5994\"},{\"1\":\"Tukituki\",\"2\":\"13.89636\",\"3\":\"5787\"},{\"1\":\"Rangitīkei\",\"2\":\"13.86390\",\"3\":\"5733\"},{\"1\":\"Whangārei\",\"2\":\"13.28747\",\"3\":\"5794\"},{\"1\":\"Northland\",\"2\":\"13.28451\",\"3\":\"5914\"},{\"1\":\"Nelson\",\"2\":\"13.21589\",\"3\":\"5799\"},{\"1\":\"Coromandel\",\"2\":\"13.21031\",\"3\":\"6142\"},{\"1\":\"Napier\",\"2\":\"13.06829\",\"3\":\"5450\"},{\"1\":\"New Plymouth\",\"2\":\"13.03979\",\"3\":\"5683\"},{\"1\":\"Whanganui\",\"2\":\"12.96022\",\"3\":\"5252\"},{\"1\":\"Kaikōura\",\"2\":\"12.93786\",\"3\":\"5507\"},{\"1\":\"Waimakariri\",\"2\":\"12.54933\",\"3\":\"5787\"},{\"1\":\"Southland\",\"2\":\"12.47891\",\"3\":\"4881\"},{\"1\":\"Taieri\",\"2\":\"12.46772\",\"3\":\"5553\"},{\"1\":\"Waitaki\",\"2\":\"12.20333\",\"3\":\"5332\"},{\"1\":\"West Coast-Tasman\",\"2\":\"12.08451\",\"3\":\"5148\"},{\"1\":\"Wairarapa\",\"2\":\"11.74727\",\"3\":\"5230\"},{\"1\":\"Invercargill\",\"2\":\"10.94791\",\"3\":\"4338\"},{\"1\":\"Rangitata\",\"2\":\"10.37288\",\"3\":\"4373\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  \n\nWithin the general electorates, there is a very clear urban/rural divide, showing much higher special voting rates in the cities. This makes sense demographically (citydwellers tend to be younger) and geographically (in rural areas, with larger electorates, it is more unlikely that the nearest polling booth to your house or work will be outside your electorate).\nThe Māori electorates also all see very high special vote proportions. Apart from age (the Māori population is younger than the rest of New Zealand) and lower enrollment rates overall, I have no good theories as to why this is – the geographic explanation doesn’t appear to work for such large electorates.\nThe next question which occured to me is where were special votes pivotal to determining election outcomes? These are the electorates where the apparent winner on election night turns out, once specials are counted, to have come second:\n\nelectorate\nfinal_winner\nrunner_up\nmargin_election_night\nmargin_final\nMaungakiekie\nRADHAKRISHNAN, Priyanca\nLEE, Denise\n580\n635\nNorthland\nPRIME, Willow-Jean\nKING, Matt\n729\n163\nWhangārei\nHENDERSON, Emily\nRETI, Shane\n164\n431\n\nElectorate races though, of course, are mostly important to minor parties and to the pride of MPs and candidates. The crucial question is how special votes affect the makeup of Parliament through Party votes. That is basically a function of two things – how many special votes there were overall (496834 is the answer) and how those votes divided between the parties.\nThis shows the overall proportions of party votes won by each party before and after specials. It confirms what I said in the introduction: Nothing really changed with specials, except that Labour’s lead got marginally larger and the Māori Party got enough for a second seat.\n\n\n\nYou can only really see the effects in a table:\n\nparty\nshare_pre_specials\nshare_specials\nshare_post_specials\nLabour Party\n49.49\n54.75\n50.40\nNational Party\n26.98\n20.06\n25.78\nGreen Party\n7.62\n9.34\n7.92\nACT New Zealand\n8.03\n5.82\n7.65\nNew Zealand First Party\n2.68\n2.31\n2.62\nThe Opportunities Party (TOP)\n1.42\n1.96\n1.52\nNew Conservative\n1.52\n1.34\n1.49\nMāori Party\n1.01\n1.95\n1.17\nAotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party\n0.32\n1.16\n0.47\nONE Party\n0.27\n0.33\n0.28\n\nThere is nothing too surprising there: The left wing parties did better in specials, as expected.\n\nThe overall party vote percentage National recieved did not fall massively with the inclusion of the special votes (from 26.8% before to 25.6% after), but the fact that that small 1.2% swing shifted three solidly blue electorates to having Labour pluralities in the party vote simply shows how badly National were beaten.↩\nN.b., I have excluded Paul Goldsmith from this regression because of the unique electoral situation in Epsom. This is new in the post-specials version of this article.↩\n",

    "contents": "\nThe data have been updated. They now represent 100% of votes counted on election night. This post was originally published on RPubs, but now I’ve moved it to my own Github pages site.\nWow. What a result. The broad national narrative of Election 2020 for each party seems clear:\nLabour got a stonking victory, delivering a massive personal mandate for Jacinda Ardern\nNational had a dismal night, which managed to be worse than expected\nACT had a great night, confirming months of positive polling\nThe Greens outperformed, though perhaps Labour’s result was marginally too good for their tastes.\nThe Maori Party might be back from the dead\nNew Zealand First should be dead for good – although making that prediction is perhaps never wise\nHowever there is also much to be said about the individual constituencies at play. That is what I’m going to do in this post. I’m not making an argument in this post, just exploring the data to see what happens.\nA couple of notes first:\nThese data were scraped from the Electoral Commissions website at around 1am NZT, when just under 100% of advance and ordinary votes had been counted. They may have changed marginally since then. N.B. This is no longer true. See the note above.\nSpecial votes won’t be counted for some time, which, given how tight some of the constituency results were, might effect this analysis.\nThis analysis was conducted late at night – taking advantage of my time difference from being based in Singapore – and quickly so it might not be right. I have released my source code on Github, please let me know if something looks off.\nPlease feel free to email me at mp (at) mitchellpalmer.nz if you have any questions.\nWhy is this interesting?\nFinding out where the votes for each party were found tells us a lot about their electoral strategy and the coalitions they have built. It also lets us find out who the most popular MPs are, aside from their party affiliation.\nThis election, however, it is particularly interesting for two reasons.\nFirstly, because of the utter implosion of the National party vote but the smaller fall in their electorate votes, a significant proportion of National’s seats will be filled by electorate MPs. Thus, while your electorate vote may not decide the government, it will shape the balance of power within the opposition.\nSecondly, three minor parties may have managed to sieze or hold electorates: ACT retained its traditional stronghold of Epsom with an increased majority; the Maori Party have most likely siezed Waiariki; and, after a much-reported-on three-way race, the Greens look to have taken Auckland Central. Given the coat-tailing rules in MMP, a growing trend of minor parties winning electorates could substantially change the make-up of Parliament.\nHow did the parties do?\n\n\n\nClearly, National significantly outperformed in candidate votes compared to their party vote performance. That is mirrored in the constituency counts: National had the plurality (i.e., the most votes) of candidate votes in 26 electorates, but the plurality of party votes in only 4. Why? Three possibilities occur to me (ranked in order of estimated importance):\nElectorate votes are sticky: Perhaps voters are less willing to abandon their local MP, to whom they can attach a face and a name, than parties, which after all are simply brands. Given National won the most electorates in 2017, that this stickiness favoured National is unsurprising.\nNational’s local campaigns were better than their national campaign: Perhaps the collegial nature of constituency committees and the independent mandates of MPs with their supporters meant that local campaigns worked together better than the chaotic national National Party.\nNational’s candidates were better than Labour’s candidates: In my view, this is definitely true in many parts of the country (e.g., Hutt South), but I struggle to think of any non-partisan reason this would be true generally. If it is true though, it certainly would help explain this phenomenon.\n\n\n\nAs an aside, readers may be surprised to see such strong candidate vote performances from ACT and Greens, both of which have been known to run party vote-focused campaigns. This can mostly be explained by strong performances in their targetted ‘backstop’ seats (Epsom and Auckland Central), which they presumably seek/sought as an insurance policy to keep them in Parliament if they recieved less than 5% of the party vote. Indeed, 20.22% of ACT’s total electorate votes were in Epsom and 7.46% of the Greens’ total electorate votes were in Auckland Central. By contrast, if Green candidate votes were equally distributed across the country, given they ran in 60 seats, one would expect them to have recieved 1.67% of their candidate votes in each seat.\nAs mentioned above, the National Party achieved a plurality in only four of the 72 electorates this election. Which were those seats?\n\nelectorate\nparty\nparty_vote_share\nEpsom\nNational Party\n39.87\nTāmaki\nNational Party\n38.40\nTaranaki-King Country\nNational Party\n37.49\nWaikato\nNational Party\n38.65\n\n\n\n\nNotably absent from that list are National strongholds like Pakuranga (where Simeon Brown won by 9756), Selwyn (where Nicola Grigg won by a distance of 4943) and Judith Collins’ own seat of Papakura (which she took by 5925 votes). Those are a lot of traditionally National seats where another party (i.e., Labour) won the most votes. Those are seats National may well have lost in a first-past-the-post system.\nBut, perhaps National suffered from the success of its resurgent partners, ACT? Those are still votes for the right, so they shouldn’t count as real loses, the logic might go. While that certainly does help, it doesn’t make a real difference: In a good-old-fashioned two-party FPP election, National would still have lost resoundingly. When one sums the left bloc (Greens and Labour) and the right bloc (ACT and National), the right still only takes 12 seats out of 72 avaliable, none of which they would hold by more than 3000 votes. Even Selwyn, long National’s safest seat or close to it, would have been marginal: The right led there by less than 700 votes.\n\nelectorate\nright_bloc\nleft_bloc\nright_majority\nTaranaki-King Country\n16849\n13971\n2878\nWaikato\n17249\n14548\n2701\nTāmaki\n17460\n15153\n2307\nEpsom\n16618\n14313\n2305\nWhangaparāoa\n18710\n16508\n2202\nSouthland\n17148\n15055\n2093\nPort Waikato\n16512\n14510\n2002\nPapakura\n15354\n13996\n1358\nPakuranga\n15404\n14056\n1348\nEast Coast Bays\n15500\n14515\n985\nSelwyn\n17625\n16996\n629\nKaipara ki Mahurangi\n16858\n16273\n585\n\nHow did the candidates do?\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a strong relationship between how a party performed and how its candidates performed. Plugging the party vote and candidate vote into a simple linear regression shows that, for a major party candidate in a general electorate, 61.17% of the variation in their candidate vote can be predicted from the party vote. Once the model accounts for the overall differences between National and Labour this year, the proportion accounted for shoots up to 79.19%.\n\n\n\nThe obvious question then is “What about that 20.81%”? Which candidates did well? By regressing the candidate vote against both the party from which the candidate comes and that party’s party vote, we can come up with the predicted result of an ‘average’ National/Labour candidate standing in that seat and work out which candidates beat that ‘benchmark’. Here are the list from Labour:\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"electorate\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"winner\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"lgl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"predicted_cv\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate_vote\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"outperformance\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Mt

immediately conclude from this that every Labour MP should have campaigned like Duncan Webb and every National MP should have campaigned like Chris Bishop. An MP who did a bad job spreading the party vote message in their constituency, but did a passable one promoting themselves, would do very well on this metric. But we can conclude that a constituency candidate’s fate is not entirely in the hands of their party – they can change it in or against their own favour. (A better model would also account for incumbency bias – outperformers tend to be incumbents, probably because of their preexisting local profile – and perhaps also the depth of the field – so as to avoid unduly punishing candidates like Helen White who run in the three-horse races.)\nWhere did they do well?\nThis will be a longer post sometime in the future. In that post, I’ll see what predicts support for each of the parties based on the characteristics of the constituencies. But, in the mean time, here are the party votes cast in the general electorates aggregated into some rough regions (please excuse my poor New Zealand geography, especially residents of the Central North Island – I have no reason to be bad at it. I just am.):\nThe aforementioned post is avaliable here: https://mitchellpalmer.shinyapps.io/Election2020Interactive/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
