    "contents": "\nThere has been quite some bruhaha about a recent estimate from Shaun Hendy and his team at TPM that, were NZ to open up with 75% of the population fully vaccinated (or 80% of over-5s), approximately 7000 people could die. I am far from an expert on proper epidemiological modelling, so I will leave those critiques to others. What I want to do in this post is briefly sense-check Hendy’s numbers against some numbers we do know – vaccine efficacy and case-fatality rates, for instance – and see whether the implications make sense.\nHendy’s model predicts that roughly 7,000 people could die. Out of a population of roughly 5 million, that’s a population-fatality rate (which I’ll call \\(f_t\\) for fatality rate, total) of 0.14% – i.e., 14 in every 1000 New Zealanders would die of COVID in the next year. That number can be deconstructed as the average of the population-fatality rate of vaccinated people (\\(f_v\\)) and the population-fatality rate of unvaccinated people (\\(f_u\\)), weighted by the proportion of people vaccinated (which is a known quantity in this case – 75%).\n\\[\nf_t = 0.75f_v + 0.25f_u\n\\]\nThe efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against death from the Delta variant appears to be at least 90%. For conservatism’s sake, we’ll say it is exactly 90%. This means that we can assume \\(f_v= (1-0.9)f_u\\) – i.e., the fatality rate among vaccinated people will be 90% less than that of unvaccinated people. Therefore, if you follow my algebra below, we find that the implied unvaccinated fatality rate is 0.43% – i.e., 43 in every 1000 unvaccinated New Zealanders would die in the next 12 months.\n\\[\nf_t = 0.75(1-0.9)f_u + 0.25f_u \\\\\nf_u = \\frac{1}{0.325}f_t \\\\\nf_u = \\frac{1}{0.325}\\left(\\frac{7000}{5\\times10^6}\\right) \\\\ \nf_u = 0.43\\%\n\\]\nThis also implies a vaccinated fatality rate of 0.04%. Given a 75% vaccination rate, that means roughly 1600 vaccinated people (out of 3.75 million) and roughly 5400 unvaccinated people (out of 1.25 million) would die.\nLet us return to the fatality rate of the unvaccinated people. Your probability of dying from a disease is the product of two numbers: Your probability of catching that disease (what I’ll call the ‘infection rate’ \\(i_u\\)) and your probability of dying from that disease, conditional on having caught it (which is the infection-fatality rate, which is well-known to most of us by now, but which I will call \\(d_u\\)).\n\\[\nf_u = i_u \\cdot d_u\n\\]\nUnfortunately, we do not know what the true infection-fatality rate of COVID-19 is, because we simply do not know how many people have caught or died from COVID during the pandemic so far. Nonetheless, the case fatality ratio – which measures the proportion of diagnosed COVID cases who have died – is an acceptable proxy, so long as we redefine the infection rate to mean the likelihood of being diagnosed, rather than infected, with the disease.\nDespite this accomodation, it is still difficult to find case-fatality rates for unvaccinated patients with delta in the rich world, given that the variant emerged just as most rich countries ramped up their vaccine programmes. Nonetheless, we can deal with an approximation that, where testing has kept up with the outbreak (if testing fails to keep up, the denominator of total cases becomes meaningless), most rich countries have had a case-fatality rate of roughly 2%. New Zealand’s has been lower throughout the pandemic (roughly 1%), likely because our hospital capacity has not been stretched. Three factors lead me to believe the CFR would likely be lower than this baseline for unvaccinated people if this situation was to play out:\nHappily, New Zealand’s vaccination rates of the elderly have been strong (even today only roughly 20% of the over-65 population is not fully vaccinated, compared to roughly 60% of the overall population). Therefore, unvaccinated patients are likely to be younger than the average New Zealander and thus have much serious COVID.\nWe have learnt from previous outbreaks around the world. For instance, treatments like dexamethasone, validated by the RECOVERY trial in the UK, are now validated and avaliable, which can significantly reduce mortality.\nA good percentage of the ‘25% unvaccinated’ may well have recieved their first dose and thus will be at least partially protected from the virus.\nNonetheless, if we assume a 2% case-fatality rate, that implies that 21.5% of the unvaccinated population will catch COVID – to such an extent that they would, in the status quo, get tested and be counted asa case – within one year of the re-opening. Given the infectiousness of Delta, that is seems to my uneducated eye to be a plausible number. Obviously, as your assumptions about the CFR go down, the resulting implied infection rate goes up.\nHendy and his team appear to assume a case-fatality rate of 1.38%, based on this study which is based on data from Wuhan. I am sceptical of the extent to which this data is useful in the very different context of delta and the New Zealand health system, but nonetheless, the headline CFR lines up relatively well. Using this number, we find an implied infection rate of 31.1% of the unvaccinated.\nPossibly the most important question is whether the health system could handle 21.5%/31.1% of the unvaccinated population getting COVID – in addition to the smaller fraction, but likely larger total number (given the size of the vaccinated population), of breakthrough vaccinated cases – over a 12 month period, while maintaining its standards in other areas. If we use the 21.5% figure, that is roughly 270,000 cases. For that question, we probably really need a deeper study (and perhaps to look at my rough COVID-19 Vulnerability Index) of healthcare capacity and to consult the evidence on the speed at which (and what proportion of – given not every COVID case needs to go to the hospital) those 270,000 cases will hit the system. If the healthcare system did in fact topple over, death rates could be significantly higher, even among vaccinated people. This may result, therefore, in the need to return to our policy from early in the pandemic of ‘flattening the curve’ to allow a relatively gentle transition to an endemic virus to which the population is essentially immune.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOne of the greatest dangers of Covid-19 is that it can overwhelm healthcare systems, thus degrading the standard of care recieved by all patients. Assuming an outbreak occurs, a country’s vulnerability to such an outcome can be approximated as a function of three factors:\nHow many vaccinations have been given\nHow effective those vaccinations are (against hospitalisation or serious illness)\nHow much capacity the country’s healthcare system has\nIdeally, a vulnerability index would include a variety of other factors – especially the age distribution of the population, the number of people with natural immunity to Covid-19 already acquired and the ability of the healthcare system to scale at speed – but such factors are difficult to summarise in single number avaliable for a large number of countries.\nAs such, this brief blog post limits itself to a much simpler, more tractable model. First, we consider \\(n\\) different vaccines administered in a country (\\(c\\)) with a population (\\(p_c\\)), each with an effectiveness against hospitalization (\\(e_i\\)), a recommended number of doses for a full course (i.e., 2 for Pfizer and 1 for J&J) (\\(f_i\\)), and a number of doses of the vaccine given (\\(d_i\\)). With those figures, we can create an ‘efficacy-weighted vaccination rate’ (\\(r_c\\)). This weighting accounts for the obvious fact that lower efficacy vaccines need higher coverage to reach equivalent protection.\n\\[\nr_c = \\frac{\\sum^{n}_{i=0}e_i \\frac{d_i}{f_i}}{p_c}\n\\]\nWhen we combine that vaccination rate (or, in fact, \\((1-r_c)\\) to proxy for the number of cases likely to escape, given the vaccination rate and efficacy) with a suitable proxy for healthcare system capacity – in this case, the number of hospital beds \\(b_c\\) per head, we create a vulnerability metric \\(v_c\\) which essentially proxies for how long/severe an outbreak would have to be, in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns, to overwhelm the health system.\n\\[\nv_c = \\frac{1-r_c}{\\left(\\frac{b_c}{p_c}\\right)}\n\\]\nThe Practical Stuff\nThe best source for COVID-19 data is Our World in Data, which has an incredible collection of data on many aspects of the pandemic. Unfortunately, however, its by-manufacturer data is relatively scarce. Due to my particular interest in these four countries, I have manually added the latest data for Singapore (Pfizer/Moderna is assumed at 50% share each, together with 100% of non-government vaccines being Sinovac), Australia (sourced from the TGA safety reports), New Zealand (from the Ministry of Health), and the United Kingdom (from the MHRA safety data) to their dataset.\nEstimating efficacy-weighted vaccination rates\nWe start with OWID’s vaccine-by-manufacturer data (as at 16 September 2021 11pm Singapore time) with the aforementioned countries’ data added. Then we join that data with data on the efficacy of the various vaccines against hospitalization caused by the Delta variant from various sources (this data is reproduced at the end of the post). Where data for the delta variant is not avaliable, we adjust the efficacy rate down by 10% (not percentage points), which is the percentage which one study found the Astra-Zeneca’s efficacy fell by when confronted by Delta rather than other variants or the original disease. Population data is then taken from the World Bank.\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"country\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"effective_vax_rate\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"vax_rate\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Singapore\",\"2\":\"0.7597004\",\"3\":\"0.7967346\"},{\"1\":\"Iceland\",\"2\":\"0.7372704\",\"3\":\"0.8136508\"},{\"1\":\"Portugal\",\"2\":\"0.7037437\",\"3\":\"0.7665618\"},{\"1\":\"Malta\",\"2\":\"0.6909763\",\"3\":\"0.7441922\"},{\"1\":\"Uruguay\",\"2\":\"0.6896774\",\"3\":\"0.7578631\"},{\"1\":\"Denmark\",\"2\":\"0.6771784\",\"3\":\"0.7091265\"},{\"1\":\"Chile\",\"2\":\"0.6712973\",\"3\":\"0.7440058\"},{\"1\":\"Italy\",\"2\":\"0.6586963\",\"3\":\"0.6976549\"},{\"1\":\"Spain\",\"2\":\"0.6570142\",\"3\":\"0.7002692\"},{\"1\":\"France\",\"2\":\"0.6554950\",\"3\":\"0.6899592\"},{\"1\":\"United

variety of limitations to this data (notably that World Bank beds-per-capita data can be up to 10 years old [it isn’t for most countries in this dataset though] and is based on capacity, not spare capacity at any given moment), but the broad conclusion should be deeply worrying for my New Zealand compatriots: With our current level of vaccination and the current capacity of our health care system, New Zealand would be the most vulnerable rich country for which data is avaliable were the Delta variant to enter the community. On my crude metric, we would be roughly 50% more vulnerable than Australia. This seemingly validates the Prime Minister’s decision to move very quickly into lockdown given the most recent outbreak – and offers some explanation for why NSW took longer to do so. Moreover, it emphasises why it is so important for New Zealand’s vaccination programme to succeed, despite its incredibly slovenly start.\nThere is a variety of complicated modelling (for instance, using a susceptible-infected-recovered model to account for natural immunity and exponential spread) which could likely improve the specific applicability of this model to decision-making, but, as a starting point and an intuition-builder, I think it is useful.

    "contents": "\nLast night, students, faculty and staff were summoned to a meeting called for this morning to hear of the unilateral decision made by the National University of Singapore (the University or NUS) to terminate its partnership with Yale University (Yale) and close Yale-NUS College (YNC, Yale-NUS, or the College). This was billed by NUS as a merger with the University’s existing University Scholars Programme (USP) to form a New College, but it is far from it. In reality, Yale-NUS is being (gradually) abolished and having its purpose-built facilities taken over by a new institution that has little in common with the College.\nThis is obviously a very disappointing decision for the many of us who are committed to the vision of Yale-NUS. In particular, one feels for the inaugural faculty who built this institution from the ground-up and will now have it abolished before their eyes, without even a modicum of consultation. In this post, I want to offer my views on this decision and explain what it means for the future of the liberal arts in Asia.\nAs a foreigner in Singapore, I am not permitted to engage in political activity. Thus, I want to emphasise very strongly that this post is not a criticism of the Singapore government nor aimed at influencing Singaporean opinion. Rather, I seek to exercise my academic freedom, as guaranteed by the Presidential Statement of Yale-NUS’s first president and the commitments made by NUS which are referred to therein, to examine this particular decision of an independent academic institution and analyse its academic merit and implications.\nIn particular, I wish to deal with four core issues: (1) Why this is a closure, not a merger; (2) Why the process followed during the closure was deeply flawed; (3) Why the closure lacks a coherent justification; and, (4) Why this closure will weaken the liberal arts in Asia, possibly irrevocably.\nNot a merger. A closure.\nThe literature distributed by NUS almost uniformly refers to this process as a ‘merger’ between YNC and USP. The press releases from Yale and the press coverage vacillated between calling it a merger and a closure. Make no mistake, it is a closure. Little of what makes Yale-NUS special will remain after the process is complete.\nYale-NUS College is a unique university-within-an-university. Though part of NUS for legal purposes, it has all of the trappings of an independent Liberal Arts College: It has small class sizes and students are only taught by professors. It has its own independent faculty, its own course structure, its own honours system, and even issues what are effectively its own degrees. Yale-NUS students can take NUS courses and use NUS facilities, with some limitations, but the opposite is not usually true. Administratively, it is also separate: Yale-NUS’s President is answerable not to the NUS President and Board but to an independent governing board, half appointed by Yale and half appointed by the University/the Singapore Government, with a chair appointed by the Government. Crucially, it is also tied to an American institution, which subjects it to the scrutiny and standards (particularly around issues of academic freedom) of American academia.\nThe New College will have none of that. Though some faculty would work at the New College, most of the courses students would take would be at NUS. That means, whereas Yale-NUS has its own economics, literature, chemistry, and physics (etc.) departments separate from those of the University, the New College will not. They will still attend the type of courses common at large research universities around the world, taught by TAs and with 500-person lectures. Thus two-thirds of their classes will be no different to those of NUS itself. It is essentially an additional programme for NUS students merged into a standard residential college, with somewhat selective entrance requirements. Yes, it will have a common curriculum and students will live on campus for some (but not all, unlike at Yale-NUS) of their degree tenure: But housing and a Common Curriculum do not a Liberal Arts College make. Put simply: Whereas YNC students typically answer the question “Where do you study?” with “Yale-NUS”, one imagines that New College students, like the USP students before them, will answer with “NUS”, not “New College”.\nWhere two organisations ‘merge’ but only the core characteristics of one are maintained, while the other is used for its land and perhaps some of its employees, that is not a merger.\nProcess? What process?\nFaculty, staff, and students only received notice of the meeting at which the closure was announced roughly 17 hours before the meeting occurred. Before that notice (which had no details in it), only the most senior of the staff at the College had any inkling that something like this might be happening. Even very senior leaders and professors with long tenures at the college were kept in the dark.\nThe meeting was called a “town hall”, but it would be to insult the proud tradition of New England town halls to call it that. True town halls are an exercise in participatory democracy, where everyone can see and contribute to decisions being made. By contrast, during this morning’s meeting, the decision of NUS — and just NUS (Yale noted that it “would have liked nothing better than to continue [YNC’s] development”) — to shut down our College was presented to the assembled (Zoom force-muted) mass of professors, students, and administrators as a fait accompli.\nNever once were Yale-NUS students or professors asked their views on this. Nor were they given the chance to offer constructive alternative ideas.\nThis lack of preparation and consultation showed as the University was unable to answer relatively basic questions on how the transition from Yale-NUS to the New College would be managed. There was no consideration, for instance, of the almost impossible position which international students who are bonded to the Singapore government find themselves in, with their university soon about to show up on employers’ Google searches as “defunct”. Nor was there a coherent explanation of how a university with only 250 students (as it will be in 2025) could offer remotely the same diversity of courses as an institution of 1000 and why, given that impossibility, students would be expected to pay the same fees as today. Moreover, no matter how many times “a full Yale-NUS experience” was promised, the reality that Yale-NUS student organisations rely on sophomores, of which there will only be one more batch, to run them and will thus likely disappear was never grappled with.\nIt also leaves one wondering about the state in which the New College will find itself once it is established. The initial establishment of Yale-NUS took roughly four years from the initial concept to enrolling students. New College, though a remarkably less ambitious project, will have only six months.\nAll told, this was a deeply callous way to approach the demolition of what, for some professors, has been a career’s work and what, for many students, was a College on which they took a risk which had so far paid off and to which they had become deeply attached. When you talk to staff and students, the overriding emotion is shock, quickly followed in many cases by a sense of deep betrayal.\nThe justification given for this ambush at the Q&A session after the Town Hall was that this is a ‘strategic initiative of the University’. To be quite frank, that is laughable. Strategic initiatives are the very ones in which student and faculty buy-in are most important and in which errors are least acceptable. Determining the long-run strategy of a university should not be left in the hands of the executive team for the moment. It is simply too important for that. If you do not involve those who probably know best what is at stake, you are liable to make a tremendous error. Moreover, this attitude betrays a total lack of respect for the faculty and students which NUS — or Yale-NUS — itself selected and, in the case of students, has taught. If NUS cannot trust Yale-NUS students to contribute to discussions about the future of the University, how, in good conscience, can they send those same students into the workforce to contribute to even more important discussions?\nThe secrecy and subterfuge, apart from being deeply disrespectful, has also been tremendously practically disadvantageous to many. For instance, the new faculty which the College has hired and the Class of 2025 both would have made their final commitments to the College after NUS had already made up its mind to abolish it. Additionally, the faculty just completed an incredibly time-consuming and expensive review of the Common Curriculum, which will now be never be put into practice. By their insistence on ambush tactics — which seem designed to ensure that a campaign of press and political pressure could not save the College — the University has wasted all of our time and put many people in deeply unfair positions.\nThe justification, or lack thereof.\nOnce people you speak to at Yale-NUS have proceeded through the stage of shock and betrayal, the next question is always: Why?\nUnfortunately, the answer remains unclear. The closest thing to a reason given was “we wish to expand access to the liberal arts in Singapore”. That is a laudable goal, but it is unclear why it necessarily implies the abolition of Yale-NUS College. In fact, it seems to imply its expansion. There is spare space on UTown green which could be used for a new building; given the low acceptance rate, there are clearly thousands of willing students — even despite the incredibly unfavourable changes to financial aid which have been made recently — ready to attend; and, given the well-known glut of talent on the academic job market, there are presumably enough lecturers to fill any spots, despite recent shortages. Yale has also repeatedly stated its commitment to continuing its partnership with NUS, despite recent controversies about academic freedom. Whatever the problems with this model, they are issues that could have been surveyed in a transparent, open conversation with the faculty, Yale-NUS students, the wider NUS community, and the public.\nEven the hackneyed business school trope of eliminating duplication cannot explain this decision. Yes, on the face of it, it seems unusual (but certainly not unprecedented: See the duplication of economics departments in business schools and arts and sciences schools around the world) for a university to have two parallel physics departments. But, for starters, NUS has committed to no redundancies for staff or faculty, making any reduction in duplication marginal at best. Secondly, a focus on reducing duplication is entirely at odds with the broader trends in Singapore: A university system intent on reducing duplication would not have recently set up multiple new autonomous universities: Instead, it would have consolidated them into one or two universities like NUS and NTU.\nIf, as has been repeatedly stated today, the Yale-NUS experiment has succeeded, and it undeniably has, why is the University decided to abandon it just as it entered a new stage of maturity and continuity?\nWhat this means for the liberal arts in Asia\nOutside of universities, it is often said that experience is the greatest teacher. Unfortunately, the experience of this great experiment is likely to teach the lesson that true liberal arts education cannot survive in Asia.\nIf the University which is consistently ranked the best in Asia cannot, in collaboration with an American university with hundreds of years of experience in liberal education, create a real liberal arts college that lasts more than a decade in full-scale operation, what hope, one might reasonably assume, does anyone else have? The next time an entrepreneurial university president suggests this idea — which has great merit, as suggested by the fact that even NUS wishes to “expand access to the liberal arts” — to his Minister of Education or to a donor, the benefactor will immediately ask “Has this been tried anywhere else?” The president will then have to admit that “Yes, it has” and even NUS and Yale couldn’t make it work. Even if he attempts to explain our failure away, the idea will have been dealt a possibly mortal blow.\nWhere to from here\nIt is unclear what, if anything, faculty, staff, and students can do about this decision. We may simply have to adapt. But, whatever happens, this has undeniably been handled terribly by the University. They have let down the students, faculty, and staff who took a risk and in many cases moved thousands of kilometres away from home to support and enjoy the vision of a liberal arts education in Asia.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThis piece discusses the price of securities on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and other markets operated by the NZX. However, it is not investment advice and should not be relied upon as such.\nIn finance classes, we spend a lot of time on arbitrage. An arbitrage is a trade where you profit off the difference in prices between two equivalent financial assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, options, currencies, or commodities). The logic is simple: Who would spend $10 to get a series of cashflows (which is what most financial assets are) which you could get for $9? No-one. Thus, equivalent assets should have equivalent prices and, if you can bet on the gap of prices between equivalent assets narrowing, you can make money without risk. Unfortunately for would-be arbitrageurs, most arbitrages are for tenths of a cent and last for only tenths of a second. However, recent changes in the market for shares and units in Fonterra – the New Zealand dairy exporter – provide an excellent example of how arbitrage can work – and fail. That’s what I cover in this post.\nNew Zealand readers will be familiar with Fonterra. For overseas readers, here’s a brief introduction: Fonterra is New Zealand’s largest company (by some metrics) and is responsibile for the vast majority (roughly 80%) of our dairy exports, which, because of New Zealand’s outsized role in the global dairy industry, means they are also responsible for a very large portion (around 30%) of global milk exports. Fonterra is a co-operative, meaning the dairy farmers which produce the raw milk which Fonterra converts into saleable products (like milk, cheese, milk powder, and ice cream) own the firm.\nBefore the Trading Among Farmers (TAF) system was introduced in 2010, the number of shares which each farmer was allowed/required to hold was equal to the amount of milk solids they sold to Fonterra. If they wished to sell more milk solids than they held shares, they had to purchase more shares from Fonterra. If they did not sell as many kilograms of milk solids as they held shares, they had to sell (redeem) their shares to Fonterra. This made Fonterra vulnerable: Its capital could leave at any moment – and, most likely, would leave at just the moment when Fonterra, starved of milk solids to sell, could least afford for it do so.\nUnder TAF, these rules were relaxed and the system was fundamentally reformed. Farmers are still subject to minimum and maximum shareholdings as a function of their milk production, but the amount is a wider band. Moreover, they no longer need to buy from/sell to Fonterra – they can trade shares among farmers on a kind of internal stock exchange. This gives Fonterra more certainty in its capital because it isn’t on the hook for redemptions.\nAs part of TAF, Fonterra also established a new entity – the Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund – to own part of the co-operative. The FSF’s job is to convert (internal) shares of Fonterra, which due to the co-operative nature of the firm, cannot be traded with non-farmers, into (external) units which can be. Though these units do not have the voting rights of ordinary shares, they do have the economic rights, including the right to receive a dividend from Fonterra, as if they were ordinary shares. These units trade on the New Zealand (NZX) and Australian (ASX) Stock Exchanges. Farmers (and only farmers1) have the right to (within the limits imposed by Fonterra’s minimum and maximum shareholding rules) trade units for shares on a one-to-one basis and vice versa. So, for instance, a farmer could swap his shares in Fonterra for FSF units and immediately sell those FSF units on the NZX to a non-farmer. A few weeks later, another farmer could buy those same FSF units on the NZX from a member of the public and then swap them back for Fonterra shares. In the interim, the Fonterra shares in question sit on the balance sheet of the FSF and any dividends which are paid go to the member of the public who holds the units.\nThis should create a very strong linkage between the two markets. If you are a farmer (or the market maker) and you see that you can buy units on the NZX at a lower price than you can sell shares on the internal Fonterra share market, you can make riskless money by buying the units on the NZX, redeeming them for the shares, and then selling the shares on the internal market. In doing this transaction, you’ll be lowering the supply of units on the NZX, driving up their price, and increasing the supply of shares on the internal market, driving down theirs. Eventually, enough shares will be traded in this direction that the prices will end up basically equal. The opposite logic applies if the units are more expensive than the shares – but with the same result: In the end, the shares and units in Fonterra ought to trade at very close to the same price.\nAt least, all of that was true. Recently, Fonterra decided to review its capital structure. The co-op may wish to wind up the Shareholders’ Fund and return all ownership of the firm to farmers. If they do so, they would require the approval of unitholders in the Shareholders’ Fund and would likely have to purchase back their units at a premium to the market price. In order (presumably) to stop the cost of that buy-back blowing out, Fonterra has exercised its right under the various contracts and deeds which underpin this arrangement to cap the size of the FSF. That means farmers cannot exercise their option to convert their internal shares into units (because doing so would expand the assets of the FSF).\nThat has destroyed the tight linkage which ought to exist between the two markets. If farmers notice that the price of shares on the internal market is lower than on the external market, they can no longer swap one for the other and force the prices back together (and make money while doing so).\nThis can be very starkly seen on the following two graphs: Until the capping of the FSF, the two prices moved in almost perfect lockstep – in much of the graph you cannot even see the internal market line because of how closely it tracks the public market price.\nThe price of the units vs shares in FonterraNow, I have plotted the difference between the two prices. As you can see, the difference was very close to 0 for almost the entire trading period for which we have data. But as soon as the redemption linkage was severed, the relative price of the internal market collapsed, because no arbitrage mechanism existed to keep the two prices in line with each other.\nThe spread between unit and share prices in FonterraFarmer-shareholders in Fonterra are, due to the cap on FSF growth, essentially having to leave money on the table. The price differential shows clearly that public investors value marginal exposure to Fonterra more than their fellow farmer-shareholders, but – due to the change in institutional structure – they are no longer able to satisfy that demand and convert that difference into cash. Instead, they can only trade with their fellow farmer-shareholders.\nAcknowledgements:  Data is from the NZX website.\n\nThere is one exception. That is Craigs Investment Partners, the market maker. Craigs is the only non-farmer allowed to transact on both the internal and external Fonterra markets. Their role is to ensure that farmers who wish to purchase shares can always find a willing seller and vice versa.↩︎\n",

    "contents": "\nContinuing my series of election data posts from last year, in this post, I provide some graphs, showing which voters made use of the split vote in MMP last election.\nCorrection: In the initial verison of this post, the text and titles of graphs referenced the (non-existent) 2021 general election, rather than the 2020 election, as intended. This was helpfully pointed out by Maksym Polyakov on Twitter. My thanks to him. It has now been corrected.\nOne of the innovations which MMP introduced to New Zealand was the split vote. Under MMP, every voter gets two votes. His first vote – which determines (for most purposes) the make-up of Parliament and, therefore, which parties will be included in the next Government – is the ‘party vote’. That vote is cast for a registered political party and its pre-published list of candidates, not any specific individual. His second vote is the candidate/personal/electorate vote and determines which Member of Parliament will represent his region in Parliament. That vote is cast for an individual, but most candidates have a party affiliation which is listed under their name on the ballot paper. If a voter picks a candidate for his candidate vote from a party which is different to the party he voted for in the party vote, he is said to have cast a split vote. If a voter votes for the same party in both votes, he is said to have cast a “two-ticks” vote.\nIn this post, I investigate the trends in the split vote reports from the 2020 election, as released by the Electoral Commission on their excellent ElectionResults.govt.nz website, which contains data for every New Zealand election in the MMP era.\nSplit votes are not uncommon, but neither are they standard practice. Of the 2,907,801 votes cast in the last election, 928,039 or 32% were split votes. However, the rates of split voting vary signifcantly by the party for which the voter casts his party vote.\n\n\n\nAs one might expect, the people who most often split their votes are those who vote for parties which do not actively campaign for the electorate vote in most areas. Interestingly, Labour party-voters split their votes at a much higher rate than National party-voters. Let see where the split-voters from the parties choose to reallocate their votes.\nThis is the most convenient representation of this data but – due to formatting contraints – it includes only the four largest parties.\n\n\n\nIf we restrict ourselves to the Māori constituencies and exclude ACT and National – neither of which are in the top four party-vote recipients in the Māori constituencies – and include the Māori Party and NZ First, this is what the voter flow looks like:\n\n\n\nThese next graphs display a slightly broader group of parties, but do so at the cost of easy comprehensibility. To read the below graph, look first as the x-axis which tells you who the voter party-voted for, then look at the y-axis which is who they candidate-voted for. The numbers in white represent the % of the total party votes of the party on the x-axis which the party on the y-axis took as candidate votes. For instance, the 65% in the (ACT, National) box shows that 65% of ACT party-voters cast their electorate votes for National. The ACT column sums to roughly 95%, meaning that roughly 95% of ACT party-voters cast candidate votes for one of the six parties which were in either this or the previous Parliament.\n\n\n\nThe below graph shows the opposite – i.e., the percentage of people who candidate-voted for one party (still on the y-axis) which party-voted for each other party (still on the x-axis). E.g., the 15% in the (ACT, National) box means that 15% of National candidate-voters party-voted for ACT. The National row sums to 97%, meaning that 97% of National candidate-voters cast their party votes for one of the six displayed parties.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s see which electorates split their votes most often. In this exercise, I’m including only those who cast party votes in each electorate as the demoninator. Those who cast candidate votes but did not cast party votes might be considered to have split their votes by some definitions, but including them makes the computation more difficult for little reward.\nYou can click on each electorate name to see a graph of that electorate’s voter flow. The only parties shown in each graph are the parties which recieved more than 1,000 party votes in that electorate.\n\n\nElectorate\n\n\n% of votes split\n\n\nVote Flow Graph\n\n\nEpsom\n\n\n55.58\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTāmaki Makaurau\n\n\n52.00\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTe Tai Tokerau\n\n\n49.69\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTe Tai Tonga\n\n\n47.09\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWaiariki\n\n\n45.16\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTe Tai Hauāuru\n\n\n44.82\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nPort Waikato\n\n\n42.39\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nIkaroa-Rāwhiti\n\n\n41.80\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nHauraki-Waikato\n\n\n39.29\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWellington Central\n\n\n38.80\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nAuckland Central\n\n\n37.01\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nNelson\n\n\n36.08\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nMaungakiekie\n\n\n35.98\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nDunedin\n\n\n35.89\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nHutt South\n\n\n35.27\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nRongotai\n\n\n35.18\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nMt Albert\n\n\n34.92\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nŌhāriu\n\n\n34.46\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nNorthland\n\n\n33.91\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTāmaki\n\n\n33.55\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nBanks Peninsula\n\n\n33.44\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nPakuranga\n\n\n33.37\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWhangārei\n\n\n33.04\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nEast Coast Bays\n\n\n33.01\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nKaipara ki Mahurangi\n\n\n32.74\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWest Coast-Tasman\n\n\n32.72\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nRangitīkei\n\n\n32.51\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nIlam\n\n\n32.36\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nNorth Shore\n\n\n32.19\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nNorthcote\n\n\n32.15\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTaupō\n\n\n31.96\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWaitaki\n\n\n31.78\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWaimakariri\n\n\n31.65\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nKaikōura\n\n\n31.63\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWhangaparāoa\n\n\n31.59\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nRotorua\n\n\n31.39\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nHamilton East\n\n\n30.74\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nŌtaki\n\n\n30.47\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nSouthland\n\n\n30.38\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTaranaki-King Country\n\n\n30.32\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nCoromandel\n\n\n30.14\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nChristchurch Central\n\n\n30.11\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nSelwyn\n\n\n30.10\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTukituki\n\n\n29.83\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTauranga\n\n\n29.74\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nBay of Plenty\n\n\n29.67\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nMana\n\n\n28.86\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nBotany\n\n\n28.84\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nHamilton West\n\n\n28.68\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nPapakura\n\n\n28.51\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWaikato\n\n\n28.51\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nPalmerston North\n\n\n28.48\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nUpper Harbour\n\n\n28.42\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nInvercargill\n\n\n28.40\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nNew Plymouth\n\n\n28.24\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nNew Lynn\n\n\n28.15\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nNapier\n\n\n28.13\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWairarapa\n\n\n28.10\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTe Atatū\n\n\n27.61\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nEast Coast\n\n\n27.55\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWhanganui\n\n\n27.39\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nChristchurch East\n\n\n27.15\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nWigram\n\n\n26.86\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nMt Roskill\n\n\n26.45\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nKelston\n\n\n25.46\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTaieri\n\n\n25.09\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nRemutaka\n\n\n25.08\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nTakanini\n\n\n23.33\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nPanmure-Ōtāhuhu\n\n\n22.75\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nRangitata\n\n\n22.59\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nMāngere\n\n\n22.47\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nManurewa\n\n\n21.69\n\n\nPDF PNG\n\n\nThe constituencies at the top of this list will be unsurprising to those who followed the election. Epsom has long been New Zealand’s most prominent example of tactical voting. There, right-wing voters – including those who otherwise vote National – choose (and are encouraged by the right-wing parties) to candidate vote for the ACT candidate to maximise the chance of a right-wing government and to ensure that ACT returns to Parliament whether or not it exceeds the 5% threshold. Similarly, the Māori Party made a concerted effort to campaign primarily for the candidate vote in the Māori constituencies, which encouraged otherwise-Labour voters to give them their candidate votes.\nI plan to extend this analysis over time, but please enjoy it for now and let me know if there is anything specific you’d like to see.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIn the traditional post-match interview after a rugby game, you’ll often hear a captain call it ‘a game of two halves’. While that is, of course, always literally true, what they typically mean is that the halves were very different. In particular, the team which dominated the first half often failed to do so in the second. The same seems to be true in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the first half, the countries which dominated tended to be either: East Asian countries with early warning and experience in dealing with SARS or isolated rich countries with low risk tolerances. Those countries locked down ‘hard and early’, preventing the disease from becoming endemic. The obvious examples are Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, and (after initially screwing it up royally) mainland China.\nIn the second half, the countries which are dominating have tended to be countries with high risk tolerances and impressive scientific expertise, which developed, tested, and administered the vaccines fast. Most prominent in this group are the United States and the United Kingdom.\nIdeally, you would like to be in both categories: The first category have been spared the tremendous human costs of a deadly disease spreading through their societies. The second will be spared the economic costs of having to remain isolated from the rest of the world to prevent an outbreak.\nI’ve made a graph, using data from the brilliant Our World in Data, to show the various combinations of death and vaccination rates. Death is used here as a stand-in for all forms of ‘disease-caused human suffering’, including hospitalisation and serious illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see a strong positive relationship exists between death and vaccination rates: i.e., countries with lots of deaths have also tended to have more doses of the vaccine administered. There are likely a bunch of reasons for that. Two big ones occur to me:\nThe most hard-hit countries have, for some reason (likely, population age structure and better reporting), been the rich world. The rich world has the money to buy vaccines.\nCountries suffering the most from the disease are obviously likely to priortise vaccination more than other nations.\nThe winners of the first half are in the bottom half of the graph, while the winners of the second half are on the right-hand side. Obviously, the green quadrant is where you want to be – with a low death and a high vaccination rate.\nThe quadrants are themselves defined with reference to the overall rich world’s rate of vaccination and death (respectively, 70 doses per 100 people and 1183 deaths per million). For the purposes of this graph, I’ve defined the rich world as countries with a GDP per capita of more than $20,000 in international (US) 2011 dollars – which is essentially the 66 richest countries in the dataset. The rich world has, so far, had many more deaths per head than the world overall: 1183 vs 506 deaths per million. And, perhaps more expectedly, it has also administered many more vaccines per capita: 70 vs 38 doses per hundred.\nThe stand out performer appears to be the UAE, with its low (by rich-country standards) death rate and high vaccination rate. China, Israel and Singapore have also done well, managing to vaccinate their populations without incuring the dramatic human toll seen in the UK and US. New Zealand and Australia are lagging behind in the vaccine stakes, despite their impressive performance in preventing infection and death.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nPeople often say, “Everyone is special in some way”. Or, alternatively, “everyone is good at something”. Those seem like bold claims. Are they true? In this post, I use the magic of simulations to test the plausibility of everyone being special. Spoiler alert: How special everyone is depends on how much our measures depend on each other. If what we regard as important skills depend only on a few meta-skills, then there is likely to be large numbers of people left behind. If, by contrast, our skills are heterogenus and not interrelated, then most people will be able to make up for difficiencies in some areas with good performances elsewhere. This would be a world with less inequality.\nA Very Simple Model\nLet’s start with a pretty simple (and inaccurate) model. Let’s say:\nThere are 500 discrete ‘things’ which someone can be special in (characteristics, I call them – they could be height, IQ, hand-eye coordination, etc.).\nEvery individual has an quantifiable ‘score’ at each of those things.\nThose quantifiable characteristics are normally distributed.\nThese characteristics are independent from each other (e.g., how special you are at one thing is not related to how special you are at any other thing)\nFurther, let’s define being ‘special’ as being in the top 10% of the population in that characteristic. Given those parameters, how many people, out of 1000, do you think will be special in absolutely nothing? Let’s find out.\nFirst, I create 1000 individuals. For each of those individuals, I then compute a random score for each of the 500 characteristics, following a normal distribution. Those scores range from (approximately) -3 to (approximately) 3, with a mean at 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n\ncharacteristics <- expand.grid(individual = 1:n_individuals, \n                               characteristic = 1:n_characteristics)\ncharacteristics$score <- rnorm(n_individuals * n_characteristics)\n\n\n\nHere’s a random sample of the individual/characteristic pairs created by that code, together with the randomly-generated scores.\n\nindividual\ncharacteristic\nscore\n342\n471\n0.1297448\n476\n348\n0.6015418\n38\n66\n-0.0434303\n915\n464\n0.0314398\n591\n306\n0.8712442\n\nThis graph shows the distribution of scores in a random subset of characteristics, as created by the above proccess.\n\n\n\nNow, I have computed a “overall” score for each individual. This is simply each individual’s average score accross all 500 characteristics. Because each of the characteristics is independent from each other, they will typically cancel each other out. The chances of someone scoring highly in many characteristics are low. This generates a much tighter distribution for ‘overalls’. This is shown below.\n\n\nby_individual <- characteristics %>% \n  group_by(individual) %>% \n  summarise(overall = mean(score))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s work out what score you have to get to be special in each characteristic. This can be done mathematically, of course, but let’s do it using the simulated data. Here’s the distribution for top-10% cut-off points:\n\n\ncutoffs <- characteristics %>% \n            group_by(characteristic) %>% \n            summarise(top_decile = quantile(score, 0.9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, on average, individuals have to have a score greater than 1.28 to be considered ‘special’ in that characteristic. Now, let’s see how special each individual is – measured by the number of scores above the special cut-off for that characteristic they achieve.\n\n\nspecial_count <- characteristics %>% \n                    inner_join(cutoffs) %>% \n                    mutate(special = score >= top_decile) %>%\n                    group_by(individual) %>%\n                    summarise(n_specials = sum(special)) %>%\n                    arrange(n_specials)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, there are 0 individuals who are not special in anything.\nA Slightly More Realistic Model\nObviously it is not true that each of these characteristics is unrelated to each other. For instance, someone who is good at breast stroke swimming would also probably be better at rowing than someone who can’t swim at all. Let’s introduce some interpendence.\nIn this model, I introduce four ‘meta-characteristics’ which could impact all other characteristics. These four meta-characteristics have nothing special about them – and there could in fact be an arbitrary number of meta-characteristics. But, for the sake of this argument, let’s assume there are four meta-characteristics. These meta-characteristics impact every other characteristic, but are indepdent from each other. Let’s call them intelligence (I), creativity (C), emotional capability (E), and physical aptitude (P). (Again, these four are just picked out of thin air. What they are doesn’t really matter.) Obviously, not every characteristic will depend equally on those four. Some skills – like chess – might mostly be based on I, while others – like sprinting – might depend mostly on P. Moreover, not all the variation in skills will be due to those four. Each skill might itself have something unique about it – let’s call it U. Let’s say each of those factors contributes \\(x\\)% to an individual’s total skill in each pursuit. Their total score could be given by\n\\[\nT = x_II+x_CC + x_EE + x_PP + x_uU\n\\] Necesarily, \\(x_I+x_C+ x_E+ x_P+ x_u=1\\).\nNow, let’s randomly generate 500 non-meta characteristics, each with their own \\(x\\)-values.\n\n\ncharacteristics_to_generate <- 500\n\ngenerate_coefficients <- function() {\n  \n  coefs <- numeric(5)\n  \n  # Ensures that the coefficients all add up to 1\n  remaining_pct <- 1\n  for (i in 1:4) {\n    coefs[i] <-runif(1, max=remaining_pct)\n    remaining_pct <-remaining_pct-coefs[i] \n  }\n  coefs[5] <- remaining_pct\n  \n  match <- as.data.frame(sample(coefs))\n  match$code <- c('I','C','E','P','U')\n  \n  to_return <- match %>% pivot_wider(names_from = code, values_from = \"sample(coefs)\")\n  \n  return(as.data.frame(to_return))\n  \n}\n\nmeta.coefs <- data.frame(characteristic=numeric(),\n                      I=numeric(),\n                      C=numeric(),\n                      E=numeric(),\n                      P=numeric(),\n                      U=numeric())\n\nfor (i in 1:characteristics_to_generate) {\n  d <- generate_coefficients()\n  d$characteristic <- i\n  meta.coefs <- meta.coefs %>% bind_rows(d)\n}\n\n\n\nHere’s what a sample of those non-meta characteristics, together with their randomly-generated coefficients, looks like:\n\ncharacteristic\nI\nC\nE\nP\nU\n420\n0.0788430\n0.1893252\n0.0203186\n0.0117644\n0.6997489\n263\n0.1120078\n0.2809451\n0.0302990\n0.0806747\n0.4960733\n394\n0.7091299\n0.2013960\n0.0071228\n0.0790491\n0.0033022\n438\n0.0003763\n0.0058852\n0.9916222\n0.0020564\n0.0000599\n153\n0.6192793\n0.1214425\n0.2363449\n0.0086217\n0.0143115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have to generate the meta-characteristic scores for each individual. Once again, these will normally distributed.\n\n\nmeta.indiv <- data.frame(individual=1:n_individuals,\n                      I=rnorm(n_individuals),\n                      C=rnorm(n_individuals),\n                      E=rnorm(n_individuals),\n                      P=rnorm(n_individuals))\n\n\n\nHere’s what a sample of these randomly-generated scores looks like:\n\nindividual\nI\nC\nE\nP\n880\n0.1699370\n-0.4522160\n0.2598345\n-0.7248564\n733\n-2.6323271\n-1.0038183\n-0.7816725\n0.1492215\n884\n-1.2243767\n-0.1290599\n0.6870071\n0.5120966\n807\n-1.6953239\n2.1782578\n-0.2234895\n-0.6952718\n477\n0.9212673\n1.2377749\n-0.9057107\n-0.7111390\n\nThis is what the distribution of meta scores looks like over the whole population:\n\n\n\nNow we have to combine these two to create the characteristic scores for each individual in the normal (non-meta) characteristics. Further, we have to generate the unqiue terms for each individual/characteristic pair representing the individual’s score in that particular characteristic which is indepedent of the meta-characteristics.\n\n\nnonmeta.indiv <- expand.grid(individual = 1:n_individuals, \n                             characteristic = 1:characteristics_to_generate)\nnonmeta.indiv$U <- rnorm(n_individuals*characteristics_to_generate)\n\nnonmeta.indiv <- nonmeta.indiv %>% \n  inner_join(meta.indiv) %>%\n  inner_join(meta.coefs, \n             by=c(\"characteristic\"), \n             suffix=c(\".indiv\", \".coef\")) %>%\n  mutate(score = (I.indiv * I.coef) + (C.indiv * C.coef) +\n           (E.indiv * E.coef) + (P.indiv * P.coef)  + \n           (U.indiv * U.coef))\n\n\n\nHere’s what a sample of these individual/characteristic pairs looks like:\n\nindividual\ncharacteristic\nU.indiv\nI.indiv\nC.indiv\nE.indiv\nP.indiv\nI.coef\nC.coef\nE.coef\nP.coef\nU.coef\nscore\n842\n25\n-0.11\n-0.82\n0.32\n-0.57\n0.90\n0.84\n0.12\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n-0.66\n793\n151\n0.37\n0.61\n0.13\n-0.01\n0.53\n0.52\n0.04\n0.41\n0.01\n0.02\n0.33\n211\n481\n-0.31\n1.26\n-0.73\n-0.15\n-0.83\n0.53\n0.00\n0.00\n0.03\n0.43\n0.52\n948\n393\n1.15\n-0.24\n1.22\n0.56\n0.11\n0.23\n0.13\n0.06\n0.52\n0.06\n0.27\n764\n331\n-0.45\n2.18\n0.46\n0.72\n0.07\n0.09\n0.04\n0.19\n0.03\n0.65\n0.07\n\nHere are the distributions of those scores for 5 randomly chosen characteristics, together with their score formulae.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s once again compute a “overall” score for each individual. Naturally, these have a much wider range than did overall scores in the previous, more naive model. This is because much of the variance in overall score is driven by only 4 variables. With only 4 variables, there are likely to be many more people who cannot make up their diffencies with strong performances elsewhere.\n\n\nby_individual2 <- nonmeta.indiv %>% group_by(individual) %>% summarise(overall = mean(score))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s work out what score you have to get to be special in each characteristic. Naturally, because of the broader dispersion of outcomes shown above, the score to become special is lower in a world where skills are inter-related.\n\n\ncutoffs2 <- nonmeta.indiv %>% \n            group_by(characteristic) %>% \n            summarise(top_decile = quantile(score, 0.9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen let’s apply those requirements to all of the individual scores in each characteristic. Once again, because of the dispersion in outcomes, we see a very different graph.\n\n\nspecial_count2 <- nonmeta.indiv %>% \n                    inner_join(cutoffs2) %>% \n                    mutate(special = score >= top_decile) %>%\n                    group_by(individual) %>%\n                    summarise(n_specials = sum(special)) %>%\n                    arrange(n_specials)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this new model, 4 individuals are not special in anything.\nConclusions\nOn slightly more realistic assumptions, therefore, it looks like not everyone is guaranteed to be special. However, the different results we recieved from each model are important in themselves. When more of one’s variance is due to a few factors, that increases the likelihood that people will not be able to compensate for weakness in one area with strength in another. That has interesting implications for how we think about, for instance, the disappearance of manual labour work. As jobs become increasing knowledge-focused, our performance coalesces more and more around one factor – intelligence. That increases the likelihood that some people will fall behind, even if, in previous times, their physical strength or other characteristics could have compensated. We should be careful to consider this when designing social policy.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI am currently working on reimplementing, with New Zealand data, David Miles and Victoria Monro’s interesting working paper (Miles and Monro 2019) in which they deconstruct the drivers of UK house prices to understand what effect lower interest rates are having on housing costs. (The Bank of England blog has a great non-technical explanation of Miles and Munro’s work.) As part of that work, I have to find estimates for rental yields in New Zealand over time and compare them to the prevailing risk-free interest rate. That has yielded some counter-intuitive results.\nRental yields are the gross (annual) rent payments received from a property as a proportion of its market value. Put mathematically: \\(Yield = \\frac{Rent \\times 52}{Market Price}\\). Thus, if prices increase while rents are held constant (or increase more slowly), the yield will fall. Similarly, if rents increase while house prices stay the same, the yield will increase. On a national basis, they can be estimated by dividing the average rent by the average house price. This number is particularly important in our current conversation about the role of the Reserve Bank in driving house price inflation. RBNZ targets the Consumer Price Index, which includes rents, but does not include house prices. Thus, if house prices are increasing rapidly but rents aren’t rising quite so quickly, RBNZ won’t care so much1. We can see if house prices and rents are becoming decoupled by looking at rental yields.\nRental yields are simply an interest rate. Just as the interest rate on a term deposit represents the (gross) cash return from holding money in a certain type of investment, so too does a rental yield. As an interest rate, rental yields should increase in tandem with the risk of the investment. This is for the simple reason that, as a saver, if you were offered two investment opportunities with the same return but different risk profiles, you would choose the less risky option. As such, in order for the investment market to clear, riskier assets must offer sufficiently higher returns. For that same reason, interest rates should not fall below the ‘risk-free rate’, which can be earnt by lending to the Government.\nNew Zealand Government debt is assumed to be essentially riskless. This is, firstly, because, if it is issued in the NZ Dollar (which most NZ Government debt is), the Government can simply inflate the currency to pay off the debts if it is in danger of default, and, secondly, because the Government has a triple- or double-A credit rating even for its foreign currency debt, meaning it is very unlikely to default in any case.\nThe result of that is that the interest rate of any given asset can be understood as a function of two numbers: One, the risk-free rate offered by Government debt, and two, the riskiness of the asset. That is, \\(r = R_f + RP\\) – the interest rate for any asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus a premium paid as compensation for accepting a riskier asset (the risk premium).\nDespite the hackneyed saying referenced in the title2, residential property is not risk-free. Rents could, for instance, fall precipitously if a glut of supply entered the market or if demand growth slowed significantly (cf. post-earthquake Christchurch, where both happened) or, perhaps, if the Government were to make a drastic regulatory change (like Singapore’s did in 1967 when it engaged in large-scale land nationalisation) or if the world economy/bank funding crashes into a brick wall (remember 2008).\nIn addition, holding rental property is significantly more expensive than holding government debt. Remember that the yield in question here is the gross yield, before taxes or any other expenses. Maintenance must be done, rates must be paid, and a property manager must be employed (or his labour must be done by the landlord herself). In order to incur those costs, one would expect investors to demand either more cashflow or a lower purchase price for the asset (both of which would increase the gross yield). By contrast, when one holds government debt (I presume – I have never actually bought any directly), the coupon payments are deposited in your bank account more or less automatically. In a tax sense, they are essentially equivalent except for the loss ring-fencing exemption which existed for property investors until recently. (This will be discussed later.)\nBoth of these factors lead me to expect that, when I plotted rental yields on a time-series graph, they would be significantly higher than the Government bond rate. After all, if investors could get a higher yield out of lending to the Crown, why would you take the extra risk and cost of investing in property?\n\n\n\nAs the above graph shows, however, that is far from always true. Indeed, over the period from 1993 to 2015 (when the RBNZ data I am relying on stops), only 14.4% of the time did rental yields exceed the risk-free rate as we would expect. Perhaps, however, it is due to the risk-free rate I have chosen: Maybe a 2- or 5-year time horizon is more appropriate3. However, as the graphs below show, that’s not true.\n\n\n\nThe above three graphs were based on rental yield estimates from the Reserve Bank’s May 2015 Financial Stability Report. They do not appear to have released similar data since then. I am not sure how these estimates were arrived at. Perhaps different estimates would behave more predictably.\nThat question did occur to me, so I rolled my own estimate of the prevailing rental yield, based on MBIE tenancy bond data and the house price index published by the Reserve Bank (which is converted to an indicative house price). As you can see below, it tracks quite closely to the RBNZ estimate but is uniformly a few basis points higher – given I don’t know how the RBNZ estimates were calculated, I cannot tell you why that is, but my guess would be that my indicative house price is a shade lower than theirs.\n\n\n\nGiven that my estimate for average rental yield is a shade higher than RBNZ’s (0.43 pp on average), it should be unsurprising that it conforms to the condition \\(y_{Rental} > R_{f}\\) more often – in this case, 52.3% of the time, the rental yield exceeds the 10-year bond yield in my estimate, vs. 19.3% in the RBNZ estimate of rental yields.\n\n\n\nThus, even once one changes (upwards) the estimate of rental yields, the weird fact still exists: Rental yields have, for long periods over the past 27 years, been substantially lower than the risk-free rate which could be earnt by lending to the Government. Miles and Munro’s paper includes a figure which shows rental yields substantially above the risk-free rate in the United Kingdom, so this isn’t a universal phenomenon:\nFigure from Miles and Munro (2019)Unlike Miles and Munro above, I have so far compared rental yields to a nominal measure of the risk-free rate. Perhaps that is incorrect because the capital gains embedded in housing act as an inflation hedge, meaning the correct comparable security would be inflation-protected Government securities. Unfortunately, I can’t find much long-term data on the yields of inflation-protected NZ Government bonds. I would also suggest that perhaps this is not an entirely apt comparison: Housing is at best a risky inflation hedge – it might tend to increase at least as fast as CPI generally, but it is not guaranteed to do so, unlike a directly indexed security.\nHowever, even taking the relevant inflation rate off the risk-free rate to produce an estimate of the inflation-protected rate, there are still periods (although they are much less frequent – and tend to be in the middle of property crashes) when the estimated rental yield is lower than the risk-free yield. More importantly, the average gap is far lower than the 6-percentage-point gap that Miles and Munro find in the UK (you can see the average as the blue dotted line on the spread graph – it’s just over 2%):\n\n\n\nFinally, if we use the RBNZ estimates of rental yields and compare them to the risk-free rate, we find more instances of the rental yields being below the risk-free rate and a generally lower spread – because, as mentioned above, the RBNZ yield tended to be slightly lower than mine. (N.b., RBNZ’s estimates of the rental yield run out in 2015 – values beyond that date are generated by taking my estimate and subtracting an adjustment for the average amount that the RBNZ estimate was below mine. Values so generated are indicated by dotted lines)\n\n\n\nRecently, this odd situation appears to have rectified itself, for now: Rental yields are a much more explainable 500 or so basis points above the real risk-free rate. The question is: Why did it persist for so long? And why in New Zealand but not in the United Kingdom (which has also had a very buoyant property market in recent times)?\nBut just before someone yells at me about it all being a supply issue: You’re preaching to the converted. I have written policy documents calling the inability to free up housing supply the largest government failure this century. Housing supply affects house prices through the channel of rents – as more housing becomes available rents (and imputed rents) fall, which drives down house prices. That will have an indeterminate effect on rental yields (depending on whether rents fall instantly or are simply expected to fall over time), but in rough terms, supply failures increase both the denominator (house prices) and the numerator (rents) of the rental yield equation, so don’t really change it. Low rental yields are an interesting artefact of their own, though – because they affect people’s ability to access property ownership, as opposed to housing. Low yields are actually quite good news for renters, but they’re dreadful news for first home-buyer because they mean you have to collect a big deposit in order to buy a house, the purchase of which won’t reduce your rental bill by much, because as a percentage of house prices it was low.\nPerhaps investors expected capital gains. The mere expectation that prices will rise in the future will increase prices today, without any change in the current income-earning potential of the asset (i.e., the rental revenue), as investors attempt to capture those capital gains for themselves. This drives up prices without driving up rents too (because it is about future expectations, not the present situation), lowering the yield substantially.\nWhere do those expectations of capital gains come from though? The canonical model of asset prices says that the price of any cash-returning asset will be equal to the sum of its future cashflows, discounted to the present by an appropriate rate. This discounting occurs because money tomorrow is worth less than money today – asset prices thus increase as the expected value of future cashflows increases and decrease as prevailing interest rates increase. The relationship between interest rates and asset prices can also be understood more parochially in terms of lower interest rates increasing borrowing ability and thus demand for investment products.\nLet’s deal with interest rates first: If investors expect interest rates to fall over time, that would lead them to discount future earnings less (because the opportunity cost of waiting for the cash falls, as the interest which could be earnt falls), increasing their valuation of the asset. The figures below show the actual (5-year risk-free) interest rate and investors’ expectations of the (5-year risk-free) interest rate 5 years hence4.\n\n\n\nNo clear pattern is discernable, except that investors tend to expect rates to increase when they’re high and decrease when they’re low. I don’t think this data is sufficient to conclude that it is expectations about interest rates driving these low yields, but just to check, I have plotted the expected change in interest rates against rental yields and, just as expected, there is no obvious relationship:\n\n\n\nIn terms of expected future cashflow: Perhaps there is an expectation on the part of investors that rents will increase substantially in future as a result of supply limitations and demand growth and perhaps this expectation has remained for the past 30 years. This would drive them to purchase property and drive up prices. One would expect, however, such expectations to eventually come true – and yields to increase once these increases have been fully priced in and these rents start being earnt. That does not appear to have happened yet: Rents have certainly increased, but prices have increased even further.\nPerhaps the fact that prices are outstripping rents (and interest rates) suggests it isn’t (or, perhaps, wasn’t) fundamentals driving the housing market, but a greater fool theory of pricing. Investors assume that these assets will be worth more in the future, not because of higher cashflows or lower interest rates (both of which are eminently sensible reasons for prices to increase) but simply because of a mania for housing assets. That suggests the existence of a housing bubble. (This isn’t investment advice, just a possible interpretation of the data.) However, given rental yields have adopted a more normal posture recently, I would suggest this bubble may have slowed down if it did exist in the first place.\nPerhaps, also the previous unusual tax treatment of residential property has artificially held down yields. The non-ring-fencing of property losses, which allowed losses in residential property investment to be claimed against non-property income to reduce taxable income, might have encouraged investors to bid somewhat more than was immediately economic for properties, in the knowledge that these short-term losses would be offset somewhat by reducing their tax bill. Perhaps the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing also plays some part in this. The returns of housing (i.e., imputed rents) aren’t taxed (when the house is owned by the occupier), whereas the returns of alternative forms of investment (e.g., KiwiSaver) are. This doesn’t affect property investors directly, but owner-occupiers also receive a yield-in-kind (in the form of rents they don’t have to pay). If those returns are not taxed, they might be willing to accept a lower gross yield and thus bid higher – this will have a downstream impact on the yields earnt by investors as asset prices increase.\nPerhaps, however, investors have seriously, at times, believed that debt issued by the New Zealand government was a more risky investment than residential property. If they have so believed, I have some bridges to sell them. More likely, those weird anomalies are a result of property transactions having large transaction costs and rents being somewhat sticky.\nThe New Zealand rental yield does appear unusually stable. Compare the fluctuations in the UK rental yield to those in New Zealand – the UK yield appears to have ranged from roughly 13% in the mid-1990s to around 5% just before the GFC, whereas New Zealand’s yield (rather, my estimate thereof) has ranged from a maximum of 7.61% in 1993 to a minimum of 3.92% in 2016. By contrast, both countries’ headline interest rates have varied by large (and broadly similar) amounts. I am not sure why the market is sticky (especially given New Zealand has no obvious regulatory stickiness imposed, e.g., rent controls or strict tenancy protections), but it appears to be.\nI don’t have a favourite theory, but I think this is an interesting datapoint. I would be interested to hear people’s thoughts on it.\n\n\n\nMiles, David, and Victoria Monro. 2019. “UK house prices and three decades of decline in the risk‑free real interest rate.” Bank of England working papers 837. Bank of England. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/uk-house-prices-and-three-decades-of-decline-in-the-risk-free-real-interest-rate.\n\n\nAt least, they won’t target it directly as part of their inflation-targeting mandate. Their financial stability mandate does lead the RBNZ to care about house prices, however, explaining why they have adopted macro-prudential tools like LVR restrictions on mortgage lending in the past.↩\nAccording to the OED, “as safe as houses” dates back at least to 1850.↩\nUnfortunately, the 1-year wholesale bond data from RBBNZ has many gaps in it.↩\nThese expectations are derived using the standard equation for converting spot rates at different durations into forward rates↩\n",

[NEW]\nHow were the special votes distributed? [NEW]\n\nI wrote a post on Election Night laying out how the various parties performed across the 72 electorates in New Zealand. Since then, approximately half a million more special votes have been counted. A number of people, both on Twitter and in private correspondence, have asked me to update my analysis with those new numbers. That’s what this post does.\nThe specials did not really shift the broad picture – destruction for National and elation for Labour – but simply emphasised it (with the possible exeception of the Māori Party getting two MPs).This post is therefore essentially a copy-paste of my previous analysis with annotations explaining how the inclusion of the special votes has changed the story: Struck-through text is text which appeared in the original version, but is no longer true when special votes are counted. Bold text is new with special votes. The graphs and tables and in-text numbers are entirely populated with new data. You can see the pre-specials figures here. Some new analysis, including of the effect and spread of special votes, is included at the end.\nWow. What a result. The broad national narrative of Election 2020 for each party seems clear:\nLabour got a stonking victory, delivering a massive personal mandate for Jacinda Ardern\nNational had a dismal night, which managed to be worse than expected\nACT had a great night, confirming months of positive polling\nThe Greens outperformed, though perhaps Labour’s result was marginally too good for their tastes.\nThe Māori Party might be are back from the dead\nNew Zealand First should be dead for good – although making that prediction is perhaps never wise\nHowever there is also much to be said about the individual constituencies at play. That is what I’m going to do in this post. I’m not making an argument in this post, just exploring the data to see what happens.\nA couple of notes first:\nThese data were scraped from the Electoral Commissions website at around 1am NZT, when just under 100% of advance and ordinary votes had been counted. They may have changed marginally since then.\nSpecial votes won’t be counted for some time, which, given how tight some of the constituency results were, might effect this analysis.\nThis analysis was conducted late at night – taking advantage of my time difference from being based in Singapore – and quickly so it might not be right. I have released my source code on Github, please let me know if something looks off.\nPlease feel free to email me at mp (at) mitchellpalmer.nz if you have any questions.\nI no longer have the excuse of lateness or urgency if anything is broken, but please still let me know if you spot anything amiss.\nIn addition, I should disclose that I worked for ACT during this election, not that there is much opportunity for any of this analysis to take a partisan slant.\nWhy is this interesting?\nFinding out where the votes for each party were found tells us a lot about their electoral strategy and the coalitions they have built. It also lets us find out who the most popular MPs are, aside from their party affiliation.\nThis election, however, it is particularly interesting for two reasons.\nFirstly, because of the utter implosion of the National party vote but the smaller fall in their electorate votes, a significant proportion of National’s seats will be filled by electorate MPs. Thus, while your electorate vote may not decide the government, it will shape the balance of power within the opposition.\nSecondly, three minor parties may have managed to sieze or hold electorates: ACT retained its traditional stronghold of Epsom with an increased majority; the Māori Party have most likely siezed Waiariki; and, after a much-reported-on three-way race, the Greens look to have taken Auckland Central. Given the coat-tailing rules in MMP, a growing trend of minor parties winning electorates could substantially change the make-up of Parliament. This year, we have seen the coat-tailing rule in action for the first time in a little while, with Debbie Ngarewa-Packer coming in on the list for the Māori Party, despite the party recieving less than 5% of the party vote..\nHow did the parties do?\n\n\n\nClearly, National significantly outperformed in candidate votes compared to their party vote performance. That is mirrored in the constituency counts: National had the plurality (i.e., the most votes) of candidate votes in 26 23 electorates, but the plurality of party votes in only four one1. Why? Three possibilities occur to me (ranked in order of estimated importance):\nElectorate votes are sticky: Perhaps voters are less willing to abandon their local MP, to whom they can attach a face and a name, than parties, which after all are simply brands. Given National won the most electorates in 2017, that this stickiness favoured National is unsurprising.\nNational’s local campaigns were better than their national campaign: Perhaps the collegial nature of constituency committees and the independent mandates of MPs with their supporters meant that local campaigns worked together better than the chaotic national National Party.\nNational’s candidates were better than Labour’s candidates: In my view, this is definitely true in many parts of the country (e.g., Hutt South), but I struggle to think of any non-partisan reason this would be true generally. If it is true though, it certainly would help explain this phenomenon.\n\nI think reason 3 is especially doubtful given the well-documented problems seen in National’s candidate selection process recently.\n\n\n\nAs an aside, readers may be surprised to see such strong candidate vote performances from ACT and Greens, both of which have been known to run party vote-focused campaigns. This can mostly be explained by strong performances in their targetted ‘backstop’ seats (Epsom and Auckland Central), which they presumably seek/sought as an insurance policy to keep them in Parliament if they recieved less than 5% of the party vote. Indeed, 19.96% of ACT’s total electorate votes were in Epsom and 7.79% of the Greens’ total electorate votes were in Auckland Central. By contrast, if Green candidate votes were equally distributed across the country, given they ran in 60 seats, one would expect them to have recieved 1.67% of their candidate votes in each seat.\nAs mentioned above, the National Party achieved a plurality in only four one of the 72 electorates this election. Which were those seats?\n\nelectorate\nparty\nparty_vote_share\nEpsom\nNational Party\n37.28\n\n\n\n\nNotably absent from that list are National strongholds like Pakuranga (where Simeon Brown won by 10050), Selwyn (where Nicola Grigg won by a distance of 4968) and Judith Collins’ own seat of Papakura (which she took by 5583 votes). Those are a lot of traditionally National seats where another party (i.e., Labour) won the most votes. Those are seats National may well have lost in a first-past-the-post system.\nBut, perhaps National suffered from the success of its resurgent partners, ACT? Those are still votes for the right, so they shouldn’t count as real loses, the logic might go. While that certainly does help, it doesn’t make a real difference: In a good-old-fashioned two-party FPP election, National would still have lost resoundingly. When one sums the left bloc (Greens and Labour) and the right bloc (ACT and National), the right still only takes 12 9 seats out of 72 avaliable, none of which they would hold by more than 3000 2,200 votes. Even Selwyn, long National’s safest seat or close to it, would have been marginal: The right led there by less than 700 votes. Even Epsom, long one of the bluest (in party vote terms) seats in the country, would have been held by only 349 votes.\n\nelectorate\nright_bloc\nleft_bloc\nright_majority\nTaranaki-King Country\n19499\n17303\n2196\nWaikato\n19902\n17742\n2160\nSouthland\n19260\n17426\n1834\nPort Waikato\n19099\n17726\n1373\nWhangaparāoa\n21523\n20444\n1079\nTāmaki\n20322\n19282\n1040\nEpsom\n20023\n19674\n349\nEast Coast Bays\n18023\n17725\n298\nPakuranga\n17585\n17429\n156\n\nHow did the candidates do?\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a strong relationship between how a party performed and how its candidates performed. Plugging the party vote and candidate vote into a simple linear regression2 shows that, for a major party candidate in a general electorate, 64.74% of the variation in their candidate vote can be predicted from the party vote. Once the model accounts for the overall differences between National and Labour this year, the proportion accounted for shoots up to 85.21%.\n\n\n\nThe obvious question then is “What about that 14.79%”? Which candidates did well? By regressing the candidate vote against both the party from which the candidate comes and that party’s party vote, we can come up with the predicted result of an ‘average’ National/Labour candidate standing in that seat and work out which candidates beat that ‘benchmark’. Here are the list from Labour:\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"electorate\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"winner\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"lgl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"predicted_cv\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate_vote\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"outperformance\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Mt

shouldn’t immediately conclude from this that every Labour MP should have campaigned like Duncan Webb and every National MP should have campaigned like Chris Bishop. An MP who did a bad job spreading the party vote message in their constituency, but did a passable one promoting themselves, would do very well on this metric. But we can conclude that a constituency candidate’s fate is not entirely in the hands of their party – they can change it in or against their own favour. (A better model would also account for incumbency bias – outperformers tend to be incumbents, probably because of their preexisting local profile – and perhaps also the depth of the field – so as to avoid unduly punishing candidates like Helen White who run in the three-horse races.)\n\nDuncan Webb was chosen because he has the largest overperformance of the backbench Labour MPs who actually won their seats.\nWhere did they do well?\nThis will be a longer post sometime in the future. In that post, I’ll see what predicts support for each of the parties based on the characteristics of the constituencies. But, in the mean time, here are the party votes cast in the general electorates aggregated into some rough regions (please excuse my poor New Zealand geography, especially residents of the Central North Island – I have no reason to be bad at it. I just am.):\nThe aforementioned post is avaliable here: https://mitchellpalmer.shinyapps.io/Election2020Interactive/\n\nN.b., this interactive tool has not yet been updated to include special votes.\n\n\n\nHow concentrated was each parties’ support? [NEW]\nMy intuiton was that some parties (e.g., the Greens) tend to amass their party votes in a small number of electorates, by running up large totals, whereas others have broader geoegraphical support. The easiest way to see this is to calculate the number of electorate party vote totals one must add together to get to 50% (or any arbitrary proportion) of that party’s nationwide vote. These are the results of doing just that, bearing out my initial hypothesis – the Greens got more than half of their votes in only 20 electorates, whereas Labour took 32 electorates to recieve 50% of their overall votes. Naturally, the Māori Party also had very concentrated support – in the Māori seats.\n\nparty\nn_elecs\nACT New Zealand\n25\nGreen Party\n20\nLabour Party\n32\nMāori Party\n5\nNational Party\n26\nNew Zealand First Party\n28\n\nHow were the special votes distributed? [NEW]\n\n\n\nSpecial votes are not evenly distributed. Some electorates see many more voters casting special votes (which you must cast if you are registering on the day of the election, are overseas [like I was], or cast your vote in a different electorate to the one in which you are registered). Most commentators (and I) believe that special voters skew younger than the population as a whole – I am unaware of any empirical evidence for this supposition though, although perhaps it could be found in the excellent New Zealand Election Survey. Generally, specials are expected to favour the left.\nThese are the electorates sorted by the percentage of their party votes cast via a special vote:\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"electorate\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"specials_pct\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"total_special_party_votes\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Māngere\",\"2\":\"33.10817\",\"3\":\"10342\"},{\"1\":\"Manurewa\",\"2\":\"31.26957\",\"3\":\"9288\"},{\"1\":\"Hauraki-Waikato\",\"2\":\"29.52373\",\"3\":\"7042\"},{\"1\":\"Tāmaki Makaurau\",\"2\":\"28.99069\",\"3\":\"7626\"},{\"1\":\"Panmure-Ōtāhuhu\",\"2\":\"27.65702\",\"3\":\"8538\"},{\"1\":\"Auckland Central\",\"2\":\"27.14731\",\"3\":\"9839\"},{\"1\":\"Takanini\",\"2\":\"26.32801\",\"3\":\"9526\"},{\"1\":\"Te Tai Tonga\",\"2\":\"26.26778\",\"3\":\"7573\"},{\"1\":\"Te Tai Hauāuru\",\"2\":\"25.91164\",\"3\":\"6516\"},{\"1\":\"Te Tai Tokerau\",\"2\":\"25.78154\",\"3\":\"7043\"},{\"1\":\"Waiariki\",\"2\":\"24.37380\",\"3\":\"6471\"},{\"1\":\"Ikaroa-Rāwhiti\",\"2\":\"23.92831\",\"3\":\"5928\"},{\"1\":\"Mt Roskill\",\"2\":\"23.07449\",\"3\":\"8760\"},{\"1\":\"Epsom\",\"2\":\"22.32192\",\"3\":\"9304\"},{\"1\":\"Maungakiekie\",\"2\":\"21.85662\",\"3\":\"8137\"},{\"1\":\"Kaipara ki Mahurangi\",\"2\":\"21.54515\",\"3\":\"9861\"},{\"1\":\"Kelston\",\"2\":\"21.46078\",\"3\":\"7519\"},{\"1\":\"Papakura\",\"2\":\"21.03198\",\"3\":\"8360\"},{\"1\":\"Mt Albert\",\"2\":\"20.76788\",\"3\":\"8606\"},{\"1\":\"Wellington Central\",\"2\":\"20.71908\",\"3\":\"9906\"},{\"1\":\"Upper Harbour\",\"2\":\"19.40284\",\"3\":\"7785\"},{\"1\":\"Christchurch Central\",\"2\":\"18.73410\",\"3\":\"7512\"},{\"1\":\"Te Atatū\",\"2\":\"18.72752\",\"3\":\"7132\"},{\"1\":\"Bay of Plenty\",\"2\":\"18.72394\",\"3\":\"8352\"},{\"1\":\"New Lynn\",\"2\":\"18.33859\",\"3\":\"7614\"},{\"1\":\"Hamilton East\",\"2\":\"17.90517\",\"3\":\"7043\"},{\"1\":\"Tāmaki\",\"2\":\"17.88065\",\"3\":\"7416\"},{\"1\":\"Hamilton West\",\"2\":\"17.83837\",\"3\":\"7092\"},{\"1\":\"Botany\",\"2\":\"17.35744\",\"3\":\"6529\"},{\"1\":\"Rongotai\",\"2\":\"17.28134\",\"3\":\"7844\"},{\"1\":\"Wigram\",\"2\":\"17.25549\",\"3\":\"6662\"},{\"1\":\"Ilam\",\"2\":\"17.04217\",\"3\":\"7360\"},{\"1\":\"Christchurch East\",\"2\":\"17.00864\",\"3\":\"6872\"},{\"1\":\"North Shore\",\"2\":\"16.69557\",\"3\":\"7027\"},{\"1\":\"Taranaki-King Country\",\"2\":\"16.57327\",\"3\":\"6743\"},{\"1\":\"Northcote\",\"2\":\"16.55603\",\"3\":\"6634\"},{\"1\":\"Whangaparāoa\",\"2\":\"16.34536\",\"3\":\"7351\"},{\"1\":\"Mana\",\"2\":\"16.31905\",\"3\":\"6987\"},{\"1\":\"East Coast Bays\",\"2\":\"16.31104\",\"3\":\"6230\"},{\"1\":\"Pakuranga\",\"2\":\"16.12696\",\"3\":\"6021\"},{\"1\":\"Ōtaki\",\"2\":\"16.07412\",\"3\":\"7347\"},{\"1\":\"Waikato\",\"2\":\"15.98875\",\"3\":\"6596\"},{\"1\":\"Port Waikato\",\"2\":\"15.95819\",\"3\":\"6412\"},{\"1\":\"Hutt South\",\"2\":\"15.62362\",\"3\":\"7080\"},{\"1\":\"Tauranga\",\"2\":\"15.21699\",\"3\":\"6585\"},{\"1\":\"Remutaka\",\"2\":\"15.19037\",\"3\":\"6539\"},{\"1\":\"Ōhāriu\",\"2\":\"15.09061\",\"3\":\"6562\"},{\"1\":\"Rotorua\",\"2\":\"15.05967\",\"3\":\"5679\"},{\"1\":\"Taupō\",\"2\":\"14.80472\",\"3\":\"6463\"},{\"1\":\"Dunedin\",\"2\":\"14.74440\",\"3\":\"6755\"},{\"1\":\"Palmerston North\",\"2\":\"14.73881\",\"3\":\"5674\"},{\"1\":\"Banks Peninsula\",\"2\":\"14.52948\",\"3\":\"7161\"},{\"1\":\"East Coast\",\"2\":\"14.11531\",\"3\":\"5893\"},{\"1\":\"Selwyn\",\"2\":\"14.04800\",\"3\":\"5994\"},{\"1\":\"Tukituki\",\"2\":\"13.89636\",\"3\":\"5787\"},{\"1\":\"Rangitīkei\",\"2\":\"13.86390\",\"3\":\"5733\"},{\"1\":\"Whangārei\",\"2\":\"13.28747\",\"3\":\"5794\"},{\"1\":\"Northland\",\"2\":\"13.28451\",\"3\":\"5914\"},{\"1\":\"Nelson\",\"2\":\"13.21589\",\"3\":\"5799\"},{\"1\":\"Coromandel\",\"2\":\"13.21031\",\"3\":\"6142\"},{\"1\":\"Napier\",\"2\":\"13.06829\",\"3\":\"5450\"},{\"1\":\"New Plymouth\",\"2\":\"13.03979\",\"3\":\"5683\"},{\"1\":\"Whanganui\",\"2\":\"12.96022\",\"3\":\"5252\"},{\"1\":\"Kaikōura\",\"2\":\"12.93786\",\"3\":\"5507\"},{\"1\":\"Waimakariri\",\"2\":\"12.54933\",\"3\":\"5787\"},{\"1\":\"Southland\",\"2\":\"12.47891\",\"3\":\"4881\"},{\"1\":\"Taieri\",\"2\":\"12.46772\",\"3\":\"5553\"},{\"1\":\"Waitaki\",\"2\":\"12.20333\",\"3\":\"5332\"},{\"1\":\"West Coast-Tasman\",\"2\":\"12.08451\",\"3\":\"5148\"},{\"1\":\"Wairarapa\",\"2\":\"11.74727\",\"3\":\"5230\"},{\"1\":\"Invercargill\",\"2\":\"10.94791\",\"3\":\"4338\"},{\"1\":\"Rangitata\",\"2\":\"10.37288\",\"3\":\"4373\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  \n\nWithin the general electorates, there is a very clear urban/rural divide, showing much higher special voting rates in the cities. This makes sense demographically (citydwellers tend to be younger) and geographically (in rural areas, with larger electorates, it is more unlikely that the nearest polling booth to your house or work will be outside your electorate).\nThe Māori electorates also all see very high special vote proportions. Apart from age (the Māori population is younger than the rest of New Zealand) and lower enrollment rates overall, I have no good theories as to why this is – the geographic explanation doesn’t appear to work for such large electorates.\nThe next question which occured to me is where were special votes pivotal to determining election outcomes? These are the electorates where the apparent winner on election night turns out, once specials are counted, to have come second:\n\nelectorate\nfinal_winner\nrunner_up\nmargin_election_night\nmargin_final\nMaungakiekie\nRADHAKRISHNAN, Priyanca\nLEE, Denise\n580\n635\nNorthland\nPRIME, Willow-Jean\nKING, Matt\n729\n163\nWhangārei\nHENDERSON, Emily\nRETI, Shane\n164\n431\n\nElectorate races though, of course, are mostly important to minor parties and to the pride of MPs and candidates. The crucial question is how special votes affect the makeup of Parliament through Party votes. That is basically a function of two things – how many special votes there were overall (496834 is the answer) and how those votes divided between the parties.\nThis shows the overall proportions of party votes won by each party before and after specials. It confirms what I said in the introduction: Nothing really changed with specials, except that Labour’s lead got marginally larger and the Māori Party got enough for a second seat.\n\n\n\nYou can only really see the effects in a table:\n\nparty\nshare_pre_specials\nshare_specials\nshare_post_specials\nLabour Party\n49.49\n54.75\n50.40\nNational Party\n26.98\n20.06\n25.78\nGreen Party\n7.62\n9.34\n7.92\nACT New Zealand\n8.03\n5.82\n7.65\nNew Zealand First Party\n2.68\n2.31\n2.62\nThe Opportunities Party (TOP)\n1.42\n1.96\n1.52\nNew Conservative\n1.52\n1.34\n1.49\nMāori Party\n1.01\n1.95\n1.17\nAotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party\n0.32\n1.16\n0.47\nONE Party\n0.27\n0.33\n0.28\n\nThere is nothing too surprising there: The left wing parties did better in specials, as expected.\n\nThe overall party vote percentage National recieved did not fall massively with the inclusion of the special votes (from 26.8% before to 25.6% after), but the fact that that small 1.2% swing shifted three solidly blue electorates to having Labour pluralities in the party vote simply shows how badly National were beaten.↩\nN.b., I have excluded Paul Goldsmith from this regression because of the unique electoral situation in Epsom. This is new in the post-specials version of this article.↩\n",

This post was originally published on RPubs, but now I’ve moved it to my own Github pages site.\nWow. What a result. The broad national narrative of Election 2020 for each party seems clear:\nLabour got a stonking victory, delivering a massive personal mandate for Jacinda Ardern\nNational had a dismal night, which managed to be worse than expected\nACT had a great night, confirming months of positive polling\nThe Greens outperformed, though perhaps Labour’s result was marginally too good for their tastes.\nThe Maori Party might be back from the dead\nNew Zealand First should be dead for good – although making that prediction is perhaps never wise\nHowever there is also much to be said about the individual constituencies at play. That is what I’m going to do in this post. I’m not making an argument in this post, just exploring the data to see what happens.\nA couple of notes first:\nThese data were scraped from the Electoral Commissions website at around 1am NZT, when just under 100% of advance and ordinary votes had been counted. They may have changed marginally since then. N.B. This is no longer true. See the note above.\nSpecial votes won’t be counted for some time, which, given how tight some of the constituency results were, might effect this analysis.\nThis analysis was conducted late at night – taking advantage of my time difference from being based in Singapore – and quickly so it might not be right. I have released my source code on Github, please let me know if something looks off.\nPlease feel free to email me at mp (at) mitchellpalmer.nz if you have any questions.\nWhy is this interesting?\nFinding out where the votes for each party were found tells us a lot about their electoral strategy and the coalitions they have built. It also lets us find out who the most popular MPs are, aside from their party affiliation.\nThis election, however, it is particularly interesting for two reasons.\nFirstly, because of the utter implosion of the National party vote but the smaller fall in their electorate votes, a significant proportion of National’s seats will be filled by electorate MPs. Thus, while your electorate vote may not decide the government, it will shape the balance of power within the opposition.\nSecondly, three minor parties may have managed to sieze or hold electorates: ACT retained its traditional stronghold of Epsom with an increased majority; the Maori Party have most likely siezed Waiariki; and, after a much-reported-on three-way race, the Greens look to have taken Auckland Central. Given the coat-tailing rules in MMP, a growing trend of minor parties winning electorates could substantially change the make-up of Parliament.\nHow did the parties do?\n\n\n\nClearly, National significantly outperformed in candidate votes compared to their party vote performance. That is mirrored in the constituency counts: National had the plurality (i.e., the most votes) of candidate votes in 26 electorates, but the plurality of party votes in only 4. Why? Three possibilities occur to me (ranked in order of estimated importance):\nElectorate votes are sticky: Perhaps voters are less willing to abandon their local MP, to whom they can attach a face and a name, than parties, which after all are simply brands. Given National won the most electorates in 2017, that this stickiness favoured National is unsurprising.\nNational’s local campaigns were better than their national campaign: Perhaps the collegial nature of constituency committees and the independent mandates of MPs with their supporters meant that local campaigns worked together better than the chaotic national National Party.\nNational’s candidates were better than Labour’s candidates: In my view, this is definitely true in many parts of the country (e.g., Hutt South), but I struggle to think of any non-partisan reason this would be true generally. If it is true though, it certainly would help explain this phenomenon.\n\n\n\nAs an aside, readers may be surprised to see such strong candidate vote performances from ACT and Greens, both of which have been known to run party vote-focused campaigns. This can mostly be explained by strong performances in their targetted ‘backstop’ seats (Epsom and Auckland Central), which they presumably seek/sought as an insurance policy to keep them in Parliament if they recieved less than 5% of the party vote. Indeed, 20.22% of ACT’s total electorate votes were in Epsom and 7.46% of the Greens’ total electorate votes were in Auckland Central. By contrast, if Green candidate votes were equally distributed across the country, given they ran in 60 seats, one would expect them to have recieved 1.67% of their candidate votes in each seat.\nAs mentioned above, the National Party achieved a plurality in only four of the 72 electorates this election. Which were those seats?\n\nelectorate\nparty\nparty_vote_share\nEpsom\nNational Party\n39.87\nTāmaki\nNational Party\n38.40\nTaranaki-King Country\nNational Party\n37.49\nWaikato\nNational Party\n38.65\n\n\n\n\nNotably absent from that list are National strongholds like Pakuranga (where Simeon Brown won by 9756), Selwyn (where Nicola Grigg won by a distance of 4943) and Judith Collins’ own seat of Papakura (which she took by 5925 votes). Those are a lot of traditionally National seats where another party (i.e., Labour) won the most votes. Those are seats National may well have lost in a first-past-the-post system.\nBut, perhaps National suffered from the success of its resurgent partners, ACT? Those are still votes for the right, so they shouldn’t count as real loses, the logic might go. While that certainly does help, it doesn’t make a real difference: In a good-old-fashioned two-party FPP election, National would still have lost resoundingly. When one sums the left bloc (Greens and Labour) and the right bloc (ACT and National), the right still only takes 12 seats out of 72 avaliable, none of which they would hold by more than 3000 votes. Even Selwyn, long National’s safest seat or close to it, would have been marginal: The right led there by less than 700 votes.\n\nelectorate\nright_bloc\nleft_bloc\nright_majority\nTaranaki-King Country\n16849\n13971\n2878\nWaikato\n17249\n14548\n2701\nTāmaki\n17460\n15153\n2307\nEpsom\n16618\n14313\n2305\nWhangaparāoa\n18710\n16508\n2202\nSouthland\n17148\n15055\n2093\nPort Waikato\n16512\n14510\n2002\nPapakura\n15354\n13996\n1358\nPakuranga\n15404\n14056\n1348\nEast Coast Bays\n15500\n14515\n985\nSelwyn\n17625\n16996\n629\nKaipara ki Mahurangi\n16858\n16273\n585\n\nHow did the candidates do?\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a strong relationship between how a party performed and how its candidates performed. Plugging the party vote and candidate vote into a simple linear regression shows that, for a major party candidate in a general electorate, 61.17% of the variation in their candidate vote can be predicted from the party vote. Once the model accounts for the overall differences between National and Labour this year, the proportion accounted for shoots up to 79.19%.\n\n\n\nThe obvious question then is “What about that 20.81%”? Which candidates did well? By regressing the candidate vote against both the party from which the candidate comes and that party’s party vote, we can come up with the predicted result of an ‘average’ National/Labour candidate standing in that seat and work out which candidates beat that ‘benchmark’. Here are the list from Labour:\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"electorate\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"winner\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"lgl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"predicted_cv\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"candidate_vote\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"outperformance\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Mt

immediately conclude from this that every Labour MP should have campaigned like Duncan Webb and every National MP should have campaigned like Chris Bishop. An MP who did a bad job spreading the party vote message in their constituency, but did a passable one promoting themselves, would do very well on this metric. But we can conclude that a constituency candidate’s fate is not entirely in the hands of their party – they can change it in or against their own favour. (A better model would also account for incumbency bias – outperformers tend to be incumbents, probably because of their preexisting local profile – and perhaps also the depth of the field – so as to avoid unduly punishing candidates like Helen White who run in the three-horse races.)\nWhere did they do well?\nThis will be a longer post sometime in the future. In that post, I’ll see what predicts support for each of the parties based on the characteristics of the constituencies. But, in the mean time, here are the party votes cast in the general electorates aggregated into some rough regions (please excuse my poor New Zealand geography, especially residents of the Central North Island – I have no reason to be bad at it. I just am.):\nThe aforementioned post is avaliable here: https://mitchellpalmer.shinyapps.io/Election2020Interactive/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIn 2018, while I was still a student at Auckland Grammar, I wrote a short article proposing a radical shakeup of the New Zealand education system, based around the principle of parental choice. This article was posted as a guest post on Kiwiblog, which is run by the prominent centre-right pollster David Farrar and is the most-read blog in New Zealand. The post is reproduced below.\nNew Zealand’s education system is fundamentally broken. We are failing our kids, especially those from the poorest families. Whle our NCEA pass rates increase year-on-year, every year, our international performance has worsened. The Tertiary Education Commission found 40% of students who passed Year 12 failed international reading tests. No English-speaking country has a system which underserves poor children worse than ours. And as our system becomes more unequal, the Australian, Canadian, British, and American systems improve. As we head into a modern economy where manual labour is less and less a marketable skill, we need better education, not worse.\nOne of our greatest Prime Ministers, Peter Fraser said all New Zealanders “whatever their ability, rich or poor, whether they live in town or country” have a birthright to “a free education of the kind for which they are best fitted and to the fullest extent of their powers.” Most New Zealanders would agree with that. Unfortunately, we have failed to achieve it.\nThe problem lies particularly in the lottery of birth which determines where a child can go to school. In American politics it is a common plattitude that “a child’s future should not be determined by his zip [post] code”. In New Zealand, it is rather the size of the child’s parents’ paycheque which determines that future.\nWealthy parents can afford to move into any school zone in the country, to access the best public schools, or to send their children to private schools. For instance, the average premium charged for a property in the zones of Auckland Grammar School and Epsom Girls’ Grammar School is in excess of $500,000. Fees at Kings’ College are around $25,000 per student, per year. This is clearly out of reach of the average New Zealand family – whose average household income just breached $100,000 last year – let alone the poorest, who probably would benefit most from the upward mobility advantages of high-quality schooling.\nThe variety of choice avaliable to wealthy parents means there is significant compeitition for their education dollars. Schools compete with each other to outperform academically, culturally, and in sports. For instance, Auckland Grammar knows it must maintain high standards, otherwise many of its current and future students will jump ship to Westlake Boys’, Macleans, Auckland International College or King’s, in search of a quality academic education.\nBy contrast, look at the choices avaliable to middle- and working- class New Zealand families. Locked out of the best public schools by exclusionary zoning policies – which reach around the country; for instance, both Hamilton and Christchurch Boys’ High Schools have tight zoning requirements – and out of the private schools by the high costs, they must accept whatever their local school gives them. As much as local schools may profess to be interested in the futures of their students, they have no significant incentive to actually do so, because they have a captive audience. Instead their incentive is to meet Ministry-set targets, which they do by inflating NCEA grades and channeling their students through vocational courses, locking them out of many career paths.\nThis dichotomy suggests the solution to many of our woes: Give all parents – no matter their household incomes – the choice of where to send their children to school to introduce real competition.\nWe should begin by dezoning every public school and allowing them to choose their own enrollment scheme. We should also link the private school subsidy to parental income and increase it significantly, allowing children across the entire income spectrum to access that part of the system.\nNext, we must allow more flexibility for public schools to structure themselves: Underperforming schools should be able to be purchased by high performers who can’t fulfill demand. New Zealand has already seen this flexible model in action. In the early 20th century, Auckland Grammar, already overcapacity, set up schools around Auckland following its system and sharing its traditions and, for a period, Board of Governors. These schools – places like Mount Albert Grammar, Takapuna Grammar, and Epsom Girls’ Grammar – are some of Auckland’s premier schools even today.\nWe should also end the government subsidy of NCEA. NCEA is a system which, with its unlimited flexibility, allows schools in low-competition areas to take soft options and lock their students out of opportunity. If it is to continue, it should be on an equal playing field with credible alternatives, like the internationally-renowned Cambridge and IB systems.\nAnd lastly – and possibly most controversially – we should end the teachers’ unions’ monopoly on teaching. We should allow public schools to negotiate pay and conditions with teachers on an individual basis, rather than setting payrates nationally by negotiation between the Ministry of Education and the NZPPTA and NZEI (the unions). Schools are far more aware of their specific needs and situation than Ministry bureaucrats attempting to create a one-size-fits-all contracts. Such flexiblity would allow schools to attract top talent and pay their best teachers more, without having to take them out of the classroom and into management.\nMichael Gove called it the “soft bigotry of low expectations”; I call it paternalism: New Zealand has systematically removed the power of less-well-off parents over their children’s educations and given it to Wellington. What have we got for it? Record truancy rates and a generation of children who have no opportunity to move up in society. That certainly doesn’t sound like the egalitarian paradise New Zealand aims to be.\nWe need to change it.\n\n\n\n",
